The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-\\nbasket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated five shillings, all  inhalfpence, and twopence halfpenny short—as it took an immense time and a greatwaste of arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It  is  a  factwhich will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was  neverdrowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was,to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water  in  her  life,except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was extremely partial)she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners  and  others,who had the presumption to go 'meandering' about the world. It was in vain torepresent to her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from thisobjectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and with  aninstinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 'Let us have no meandering.'\\nNot to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or 'there by', as they say in Scotland. I was\\na posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world sixmonths, when mine opened on it. There is something strange to me, even now, inthe reflection that he never saw me; and something stranger yet in the  shadowyremembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white  grave -stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lyingout alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour was warm and bright withfire and candle, and the doors of our house were—almost cruelly, it seemed to mesometimes—bolted and locked against it.\\nAn aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of  whom I  shall\\nhave more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our  family.  MissTrotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called her, when shesufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all(which was seldom), had been married to a husband younger than herself, who wasvery handsome, except in the sense of the homely adage, 'handsome is, thathandsome does'—for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, andeven of having once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty butdetermined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window. Theseevidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off, andeffect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with his capital, and there,according to a wild legend in our family, he was once seen riding on an elephant,in company with a Baboon; but I think it must have been a Baboo—or a Begum.Anyhow, from India tidings of his death reached home, within ten years. How theyaffected my aunt, nobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took hermaiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off,established herself there as a single woman with one servant, and was understoodto live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible retirement.\\nMy father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was mortally\\naffronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was 'a wax doll'. She hadnever seen my mother, but she knew her to be not yet twenty. My father and MissBetsey never met again. He was double my mother's age when he married, and ofbut a delicate constitution. He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said,  sixmonths before I came into the world.\\nThis was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be excused for\\ncalling, that eventful and important Friday.

My father had\\noften hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian; andnow, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked in at that  identical window,pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent, that my poor  dearmother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment.\\nShe gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am indebted\\nto Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.\\nMy mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in  the  corner.\\nMiss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly, began on the otherside, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in a Dutch clock, until theyreached my mother.

'You have heard of her, I dare say?'My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable\\nconsciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure.\\n'Now you see her,' said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged her to\\nwalk in.\\nThey went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best room on\\nthe other side of the passage not being lighted—not having been lighted, indeed,since my father's funeral; and when they were both seated, and Miss Betsey saidnothing, my mother, after vainly trying to restrain herself, began to cry.

As the elms bent to one another, like  giants who werewhispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such repose, fell into a  violentflurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if their late confidences were  really  toowicked for their peace of mind, some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks'-nests,burdening their higher branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.\\n'Where are the birds?' asked Miss Betsey.'The—?' My mother had been thinking of something else.'The rooks—what has become of them?' asked Miss Betsey.'There have not been any since we have lived here,' said my mother.

'I have no doubt it will\\nbe a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl.

So my mother suspected, at least, as she observed herby the low glimmer of the fire: too much scared by Miss Betsey, too  uneasy  inherself, and too subdued and bewildered altogether, to observe anything veryclearly, or to know what to say.\\n'And was David good to you, child?' asked Miss Betsey, when she had been silent\"),\n",

Peggotty knowing nothing about her, and my mother sayingnothing about her, she was quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact  of  herhaving a magazine of jewellers' cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in herears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her presence.\\nThe doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having satisfied\\nhimself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himselfhaving to sit there, face to face, for some hours, laid himself out to be polite andsocial. He was the meekest of his sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in andout of a room, to take up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost inHamlet, and more slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in  modestdepreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody else. It isnothing to say that he hadn't a word to throw at a dog. He couldn't have thrown aword at a mad dog. He might have offered him one gently, or half a one,  or  afragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as he walked; but he wouldn't have beenrude to him, and he couldn't have been quick with him, for any earthlyconsideration.\\nMr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and making her a\\nlittle bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers' cotton, as he softly touched his left ear:\\n'Some local irritation, ma'am?''What!' replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork.Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness—as he told my mother afterwards—\\nthat it was a mercy he didn't lose his presence of mind.

That there were nowoccasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did notexclude, from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady  as  avictim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds wereloudest. That, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if  he  hadbeen taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled his hair,made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded them  with her own,and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was in part confirmed by his aunt,who saw him at half past twelve o'clock, soon after his release, and affirmed that hewas then as red as I was.\\nThe mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if at any time.\\nHe sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty, and said to my aunt in hismeekest manner:\\n'Well, ma'am, I am happy to congratulate you.''What upon?' said my aunt, sharply.Mr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt's manner; so he\\nmade her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to mollify her.\\n'Mercy on the man, what's he doing!' cried my aunt, impatiently.

I have an impression on my mind which I cannot distinguish  from  actualremembrance, of the touch of Peggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me,and of its being roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.\\nThis may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go farther  back\\ninto such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe the power of observationin numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness andaccuracy. Indeed, I think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect,may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty, than to haveacquired it; the rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness,and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance theyhave preserved from their childhood.\\nI might have a misgiving that I am 'meandering' in stopping to say this, but that it\\nbrings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part upon my own experienceof myself; and if it should appear from anything I may set down in this narrativethat I was a child of close observation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of\"),\n",

What else do I remember? Let me see.\\nThere comes out of the cloud, our house—not new to me, but quite familiar, in its\\nearliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty's kitchen, opening into aback yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in the centre, without any pigeons in it;a great dog-kennel in a corner, without any dog; and a quantity of fowls that lookterribly tall to me, walking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There isone cock who gets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of meas I look at him through the kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so fierce.Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me with their  longnecks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at night: as a man environed bywild beasts might dream of lions.\\nHere is a long passage—what an enormous perspective I make of  it!—leading\\nfrom Peggotty's kitchen to the front door. A dark store-room opens out of it, andthat is a place to be run past at night; for I don't know what may be among thosetubs and jars and old tea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a  dimly -burning light, letting a mouldy air come out of the door, in which there is the smellof soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then there are thetwo parlours: the parlour in which we sit of an evening, my mother and I andPeggotty—for Peggotty is quite our companion, when her work is done and we arealone—and the best parlour where we sit on a Sunday; grandly, but not socomfortably. There is something of a doleful air about that room to me, forPeggotty has told me—I don't know when, but apparently ages ago—about myfather's funeral, and the company having their black cloaks put on. One  Sundaynight my mother reads to Peggotty and me in there, how Lazarus was  raised  upfrom the dead. And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take meout of bed, and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window, with thedead all lying in their graves at rest, below the solemn moon.\\nThere is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of that\\nchurchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so quiet as itstombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up, early in the morning, inmy little bed in a closet within my mother's room, to look out at it; and I see thered light shining on the sun-dial, and think within myself, 'Is the sun-dial glad, Iwonder, that it can tell the time again?'\\nHere is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a window near it,\\nout of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times during the morning'sservice, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it's not beingrobbed, or is not in flames. But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is muchoffended if mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to lookat the clergyman. But I can't always look at him—I know him without that  whitething on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps stopping theservice to inquire—and what am I to do? It's a dreadful thing to gape, but I mustdo something. I look at my mother, but she pretends not to see me. I look at a boyin the aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the opendoor through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep—I don't mean a sinner, butmutton—half making up his mind to come into the church.

In timemy eyes gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing  adrowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with a crash, and amtaken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.\\nAnd now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed  bedroom -windows\\nstanding open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged old rooks'-nests stilldangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front garden. Now I am in the gardenat the back, beyond the yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are—avery preserve of butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate andpadlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than fruit has everbeen since, in any other garden, and where my mother gathers some in a basket,while I stand by, bolting furtive gooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A greatwind rises, and the summer is gone in a moment. We are playing in  the  wintertwilight, dancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath and  restsherself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers,and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I do that she likes to lookso well, and is proud of being so pretty.\\nThat is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we were both a\\nlittle afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction,were among the first opinions—if they may be so called—that I ever derived fromwhat I saw.\\nPeggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire, alone. I had been reading\\nto Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very perspicuously, or the poor soulmust have been deeply interested, for I remember she had a cloudy  impression,after I had done, that they were a sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and deadsleepy; but having leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came home fromspending the evening at a neighbour's, I would rather have died upon my  post (ofcourse) than have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of sleepiness whenPeggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large. I propped my eyelids openwith my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work; at thelittle bit of wax-candle she kept for her thread—how old it looked, being sowrinkled in all directions!—at the little house with a thatched roof, where the yard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding lid, with a view of St.  Paul'sCathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top; at the brass thimble on her finger;at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt so sleepy, that I knew if I  lost  sight  ofanything for a moment, I was gone.\\n'Peggotty,' says I, suddenly, 'were you ever married?''Lord, Master Davy,' replied Peggotty. 'What's put marriage in your head?'She answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she stopped in her\\nwork, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its thread's length.\\n'But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?' says I.

However, we returned to those monsters, with freshwakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch; andwe ran away from them, and baffled them by constantly  turning, which they wereunable to do quickly, on account of their unwieldy make; and we went  into  thewater after them, as natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; andin short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did, at least; but I had my doubts ofPeggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her faceand arms, all the time.\\nWe had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when the garden-\\nbell rang.

He said he would never, neverpart with it any more; and I thought he must be quite a fool not to know that itwould fall to pieces in a day or two.\\nPeggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always been. My\\nmother deferred to her very much—more than usual, it occurred to  me—and  wewere all three excellent friends; still we were different from what we used to be,and were not so comfortable among ourselves. Sometimes I fancied that  Peggottyperhaps objected to my mother's wearing all the pretty dresses she had in  herdrawers, or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour's; but I couldn't, to mysatisfaction, make out how it was.\\nGradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers. I liked\\nhim no better than at first, and had the same uneasy jealousy of him; but if I hadany reason for it beyond a child's instinctive dislike, and a general idea  thatPeggotty and I could make much of my mother without any help, it certainly wasnot THE reason that I might have found if I had been older. No such thing cameinto my mind, or near it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were; but as tomaking a net of a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it, that was, asyet, beyond me.\\nOne autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when Mr.\\nMurdstone—I knew him by that name now—came by, on horseback. He reined uphis horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to Lowestoft  to  see  somefriends who were there with a yacht, and merrily proposed to take me on the saddlebefore him if I would like the ride.\\nThe air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride\\nso much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the garden-gate, that I had agreat desire to go. So I was sent upstairs to Peggotty to be made spruce; and in themeantime Mr. Murdstone dismounted, and, with his horse's bridle drawn over hisarm, walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, whilemy mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company.  Irecollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I  recollecthow closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them, as  theystrolled along; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic temper, Peggotty turnedcross in a moment, and brushed my hair the wrong way, excessively hard.\\nMr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green turf by the side\\nof the road. He held me quite easily with one arm, and I don't think I was restlessusually; but I could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning myhead sometimes, and looking up in his face. He had that kind of shallow black eye—I want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into—which, when it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured,for a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced at him, I observedthat appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what he was thinking about soclosely. His hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker, looked at so  near,  thaneven I had given them credit for being. A squareness about the lower part of hisface, and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day,reminded me of the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year before. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black, andbrown, of his complexion—confound his complexion, and his memory!—made me\"),\n",

'The\\npretty little widow?'\\n'Quinion,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'take care, if you please. Somebody's sharp.''Who is?' asked the gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; being curious to\\nknow.\\n'Only Brooks of Sheffield,' said Mr. Murdstone.I was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, at first, I really\\nthought it was I.\\nThere seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr. Brooks  of\\nSheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned, and Mr.Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After some laughing, the gentlemanwhom he had called Quinion, said:\\n'And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the  projected\\nbusiness?'\\n'Why, I don't know that Brooks understands much about it at present,' replied Mr.\\nMurdstone; 'but he is not generally favourable, I believe.'\\nThere was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the bell  for\\nsome sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did; and when the wine came, hemade me have a little, with a biscuit, and, before I drank it, stand up and  say,'Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield!' The toast was received with great applause, andsuch hearty laughter that it made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. Inshort, we quite enjoyed ourselves.\\nWe walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the  grass, and looked at things\\nthrough a telescope—I could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye,but I pretended I could—and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner. Allthe time we were out, the two gentlemen smoked incessantly—which, I thought, ifI might judge from the smell of their rough coats, they must have been doing, eversince the coats had first come home from the tailor's.

But Peggotty said, with greater emphasis than usual, that we musttake things as we found them, and that, for her part, she was proud to call herself aYarmouth Bloater.\\nWhen we got into the street (which was strange enough to me) and smelt the fish,\\nand pitch, and oakum, and tar, and saw the sailors walking about, and  the  cartsjingling up and down over the stones, I felt that I had done so busy  a  place  aninjustice; and said as much to Peggotty, who heard my expressions of delight withgreat complacency, and told me it was well known (I suppose to those who had thegood fortune to be born Bloaters) that Yarmouth was, upon the whole, the finestplace in the universe.\\n'Here's my Am!' screamed Peggotty, 'growed out of knowledge!'He was waiting for us, in fact, at the public-house; and asked me how I  found\\nmyself, like an old acquaintance. I did not feel, at first, that I knew him as well ashe knew me, because he had never come to our house since the night I was born,and naturally he had the advantage of me. But our intimacy was much advanced byhis taking me on his back to carry me home. He was, now, a huge, strong fellow ofsix feet high, broad in proportion, and round-shouldered; but with a  simperingboy's face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look. He was dressedin a canvas jacket, and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stoodquite as well alone, without any legs in them. And you couldn't so properly havesaid he wore a hat, as that he was covered in a-top, like an old building, withsomething pitchy.\\nHam carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm, and Peggotty\\ncarrying another small box of ours, we turned down lanes bestrewn with  bits  ofchips and little hillocks of sand, and went past gas-works, rope-walks, boat -builders' yards, shipwrights' yards, ship-breakers' yards, caulkers' yards, riggers'lofts, smiths' forges, and a great litter of such places, until we came out upon thedull waste I had already seen at a distance; when Ham said,\\n'Yon's our house, Mas'r Davy!'I looked in all directions, as far as I could stare over the wilderness, and away at\\nthe sea, and away at the river, but no house could I make out. There was a blackbarge, or some other kind of superannuated boat, not far off, high and dry on theground, with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking verycosily; but nothing else in the way of a habitation that was visible to me.\\n'That's not it?' said I. 'That ship-looking thing?''That's it, Mas'r Davy,' returned Ham.If it had been Aladdin's palace, roc's egg and all, I suppose I could not have been\\nmore charmed with the romantic idea of living in it. There was a delightful doorcut in the side, and it was roofed in, and there were little windows in it; but thewonderful charm of it was, that it was a real boat which had no doubt  been uponthe water hundreds of times, and which had never been intended to be lived in, on\"),\n",

If it had ever been meant to be lived\\nin, I might have thought it small, or inconvenient, or lonely; but never having been\\ndesigned for any such use, it became a perfect abode.\\nIt was beautifully clean inside, and as tidy as possible. There was a table, and a\\nDutch clock, and a chest of drawers, and on the chest of drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a parasol, taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a hoop. The tray was kept from tumbling down, bya bible; and the tray, if it had tumbled down, would have smashed a quantity ofcups and saucers and a teapot that were grouped around the book. On  the  wallsthere were some common coloured pictures, framed and glazed, of scripturesubjects; such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without seeing thewhole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view. Abraham in  redgoing to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions,were the most prominent of these. Over the little mantelshelf, was a picture of the'Sarah Jane' lugger, built at Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on toit; a work of art, combining composition with carpentry, which I considered to beone of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There were somehooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not divine then; and somelockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort, which served for seats and ekedout the chairs.\\nAll this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the threshold—child-like, according\\nto my theory—and then Peggotty opened a little door and showed me my bedroom.It was the completest and most desirable bedroom ever seen—in the stern of thevessel; with a little window, where the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass, just the right height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room enough to get into; and a nosegay ofseaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls were whitewashed as white as milk,and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness. Onething I particularly noticed in this delightful house, was the smell of fish; whichwas so searching, that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, Ifound it smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting thisdiscovery in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother dealt inlobsters, crabs, and crawfish; and I afterwards found that a heap of these creatures,in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one another, and never leaving offpinching whatever they laid hold of, were usually to be found in a little woodenouthouse where the pots and kettles were kept.\\nWe were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom I  had  seen\\ncurtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back, about a quarter of a mile off.Likewise by a most beautiful little girl (or I thought her so) with a necklace of bluebeads on, who wouldn't let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hidherself. By and by, when we had dined in a sumptuous manner  off  boiled  dabs,melted butter, and potatoes, with a chop for me, a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home. As he called Peggotty 'Lass', and gave her a hearty smackon the cheek, I had no doubt, from the general propriety of her conduct, that he washer brother; and so he turned out—being presently introduced to me as Mr.Peggotty, the master of the house.\\n'Glad to see you, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'You'll find us rough, sir, but you'll find us\\nready.'\\nI thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a delightful\\nplace.\"),\n",

He soon returned, greatly improved in appearance; but so rubicund,that I couldn't help thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs,and crawfish,—that it went into the hot water very black, and came out very red.\\nAfter tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights being cold and\\nmisty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat that the imagination of mancould conceive. To hear the wind getting up out at sea, to know that the fog wascreeping over the desolate flat outside, and to look at the fire, and think that therewas no house near but this one, and this one a boat, was like  enchantment. LittleEm'ly had overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the  lowest andleast of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just fitted into thechimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was knitting on the  oppositeside of the fire. Peggotty at her needlework was as much at home with St. Paul'sand the bit of wax-candle, as if they had never known any other roof. Ham, whohad been giving me my first lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme oftelling fortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions  of histhumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe. I felt it was atime for conversation and confidence.\\n'Mr. Peggotty!' says I.'Sir,' says he.'Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort of ark?'Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered:'No, sir.

I wasso curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr. Peggotty.\\n'Little Em'ly,' I said, glancing at her. 'She is your daughter, isn't she, Mr. Peggotty?''No, sir.

So I said:\\n'Haven't you ANY children, Mr. Peggotty?''No, master,' he answered with a short laugh. 'I'm a bacheldore.''A bachelor!' I said, astonished. 'Why, who's that, Mr. Peggotty?' pointing  to  the\\nperson in the apron who was knitting.\\n'That's Missis Gummidge,' said Mr. Peggotty.'Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?'But at this point Peggotty—I mean my own peculiar Peggotty—made such\\nimpressive motions to me not to ask any more questions, that I could only sit andlook at all the silent company, until it was time to go to bed. Then, in the privacy ofmy own little cabin, she informed me that Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephewand niece, whom my host had at different times adopted in their childhood,  whenthey were left destitute: and that Mrs. Gummidge was the widow of his partner in aboat, who had died very poor. He was but a poor man himself,  said Peggotty, butas good as gold and as true as steel—those were her similes. The only subject, sheinformed me, on which he ever showed a violent temper or swore an oath, was thisgenerosity of his; and if it were ever referred to, by any one of them, he struck thetable a heavy blow with his right hand (had split it on one such  occasion),  andswore a dreadful oath that he would be 'Gormed' if he didn't cut and run for good,if it was ever mentioned again. It appeared, in answer to my inquiries, that nobodyhad the least idea of the etymology of this terrible verb passive to be gormed; butthat they all regarded it as constituting a most solemn imprecation.\\nI was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the women's going\\nto bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite end of the boat, and to himand Ham hanging up two hammocks for themselves on the hooks I had noticed inthe roof, in a very luxurious state of mind, enhanced by my being sleepy.  Asslumber gradually stole upon me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and comingon across the flat so fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep risingin the night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after all; and that  a manlike Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on board if anything did happen.\\nNothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it shone upon\\nthe oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out  with  little  Em'ly,picking up stones upon the beach.\\n'You're quite a sailor, I suppose?' I said to Em'ly. I don't know that I  supposed\\nanything of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to say something; and a shiningsail close to us made such a pretty little image of itself, at the moment, in  herbright eye, that it came into my head to say this.\\n'No,' replied Em'ly, shaking her head, 'I'm afraid of the sea.''Afraid!' I said, with a becoming air of boldness, and looking very big at the mighty\\nocean. 'I an't!'\\n'Ah! but it's cruel,' said Em'ly. 'I have seen it very cruel to some of our men. I have\"),\n",

'No. Not that one, I never see that boat.''Nor him?' I asked her.Little Em'ly shook her head. 'Not to remember!'Here was a coincidence! I immediately went into an explanation how I had never\\nseen my own father; and how my mother and I had always lived by ourselves  inthe happiest state imaginable, and lived so then, and always meant to live  so; andhow my father's grave was in the churchyard near our house, and shaded by a tree,beneath the boughs of which I had walked and heard the birds sing many apleasant morning. But there were some differences between Em'ly's orphanhoodand mine, it appeared. She had lost her mother before her father; and where herfather's grave was no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of thesea.\\n'Besides,' said Em'ly, as she looked about for shells and pebbles, 'your father was a\\ngentleman and your mother is a lady; and my father was a fisherman  and  mymother was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle Dan is a fisherman.'\\n'Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he?' said I.'Uncle Dan—yonder,' answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house.'Yes. I mean him. He must be very good, I should think?''Good?' said Em'ly. 'If I was ever to be a lady, I'd give him a sky-blue coat with\\ndiamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a cocked hat,  a  largegold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money.'\\nI said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures. I must\\nacknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease in the raimentproposed for him by his grateful little niece, and that I was particularly doubtful ofthe policy of the cocked hat; but I kept these sentiments to myself.\\nLittle Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these\\narticles, as if they were a glorious vision. We went on again, picking up shells andpebbles.\\n'You would like to be a lady?' I said.Emily looked at me, and laughed and nodded 'yes'.'I should like it very much. We would all be gentlefolks together, then. Me, and\\nuncle, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't mind then, when there comesstormy weather.—-Not for our own sakes, I mean. We would for the poorfishermen's, to be sure, and we'd help 'em with money when they come to  anyhurt.' This seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and therefore not at allimprobable picture. I expressed my pleasure in the contemplation of it, and littleEm'ly was emboldened to say, shyly,\\n'Don't you think you are afraid of the sea, now?'It was quiet enough to reassure me, but I have no doubt if I had seen a moderately\\nlarge wave come tumbling in, I should have taken to my heels, with  an  awful\"),\n",

But there have been times since, in my manhood,  many  timesthere have been, when I have thought, Is it possible, among the possibilities ofhidden things, that in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off,there was any merciful attraction of her into danger, any tempting her towards himpermitted on the part of her dead father, that her life might have a chance of endingthat day? There has been a time since when I have wondered whether, if the lifebefore her could have been revealed to me at a glance, and so revealed as that  achild could fully comprehend it, and if her preservation could have depended on amotion of my hand, I ought to have held it up to save her. There has been a timesince—I do not say it lasted long, but it has been—when I have asked myself thequestion, would it have been better for little Em'ly to have had  the  waters  closeabove her head that morning in my sight; and when I have answered Yes, it wouldhave been.\\nThis may be premature. I have set it down too soon, perhaps. But let it stand.We strolled a long way, and loaded ourselves with things that we thought curious,\\nand put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water—I hardly knowenough of the race at this moment to be quite certain whether they had reason tofeel obliged to us for doing so, or the reverse—and then made our way home toMr. Peggotty's dwelling. We stopped under the lee of the lobster -outhouse toexchange an innocent kiss, and went in to breakfast glowing with health andpleasure.\\n'Like two young mavishes,' Mr. Peggotty said. I knew this meant, in  our  local\\ndialect, like two young thrushes, and received it as a compliment.\\nOf course I was in love with little Em'ly. I am sure I loved that baby quite as truly,\\nquite as tenderly, with greater purity and more disinterestedness, than can enter intothe best love of a later time of life, high and ennobling as it is. I am sure my fancyraised up something round that blue-eyed mite of a child,  which etherealized, andmade a very angel of her.

They had something of the sort of  pleasure in us, I suppose,that they might have had in a pretty toy, or a pocket model of the Colosseum.\\nI soon found out that Mrs. Gummidge did not always make herself so agreeable as\\nshe might have been expected to do, under the circumstances of her residence withMr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge's was rather a fretful disposition, and shewhimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for other parties in so small anestablishment.

When the latter was unemployed, he sometimes walked with usto show us the boats and ships, and once or twice he took us for a row. I don'tknow why one slight set of impressions should be more particularly associated witha place than another, though I believe this obtains with most people, in referenceespecially to the associations of their childhood. I never hear the name, or read thename, of Yarmouth, but I am reminded of a certain Sunday morning on the beach,the bells ringing for church, little Em'ly leaning on my shoulder, Ham  lazilydropping stones into the water, and the sun, away at sea, just breaking through theheavy mist, and showing us the ships, like their own shadows.\\nAt last the day came for going home. I bore up against the  separation  from  Mr.\\nPeggotty and Mrs. Gummidge, but my agony of mind at leaving little Em'ly waspiercing. We went arm-in-arm to the public-house where the carrier put up, and  Ipromised, on the road, to write to her.

I FALL INTO DISGRACE\\nIf the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could giveevidence, I might appeal to it at this day—who sleeps there  now,  I  wonder!—tobear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried to it. I went up there, hearing thedog in the yard bark after me all the way while I climbed the stairs; and, looking asblank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me,  sat down with mysmall hands crossed, and thought.\\nI thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of the cracks  in  the\\nceiling, of the paper on the walls, of the flaws in the window-glass making ripplesand dimples on the prospect, of the washing-stand being rickety on its  three legs,and having a discontented something about it, which reminded me of Mrs.Gummidge under the influence of the old one. I was crying all the time, but, exceptthat I was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure I never thought why Icried. At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love withlittle Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemedto want me, or to care about me, half as much as she did. This made such a verymiserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up in a corner of thecounterpane, and cried myself to sleep.\\nI was awoke by somebody saying 'Here he is!' and uncovering my hot head. My\\nmother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was one of them who haddone it.\\n'Davy,' said my mother. 'What's the matter?'I thought it was very strange that she should ask me, and  answered,  'Nothing.'  I\\nturned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling lip, which answered herwith greater truth. 'Davy,' said my mother. 'Davy, my child!'\\nI dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me so much, then,\\nas her calling me her child. I hid my tears in the bedclothes, and pressed her fromme with my hand, when she would have raised me up.\\n'This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!' said my mother.

He seemed to be very fond of my mother—I\\nam afraid I liked him none the better for that—and she was very fond of him. Igathered from what they said, that an elder sister of his was coming to stay withthem, and that she was expected that evening. I am not certain whether I found outthen, or afterwards, that, without being actively concerned in any business, he hadsome share in, or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant\\'s housein London, with which his family had been connected from his great-grandfather\\'stime, and in which his sister had a similar interest; but I may  mention  it  in  thisplace, whether or no.\\nAfter dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating an escape to\\nPeggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest it should offend the masterof the house, a coach drove up to the garden-gate and he went out to receive thevisitor.

When she paid the coachman she took her money out of\\na hard steel purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung upon\\nher arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite. I had never, at that  time, seensuch a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.\\nShe was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome, and there formally\\nrecognized my mother as a new and near relation. Then she looked at me, and said:\\n'Is that your boy, sister-in-law?'My mother acknowledged me.'Generally speaking,' said Miss Murdstone, 'I don't like boys. How d'ye do, boy?'Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well, and that  I\\nhoped she was the same; with such an indifferent grace, that Miss Murdstonedisposed of me in two words:\\n'Wants manner!'Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favour of being\\nshown to her room, which became to me from that time forth a place of awe anddread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be leftunlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when she was out) numerouslittle steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss Murdstone embellished herself whenshe was dressed, generally hung upon the looking-glass in formidable array.\\nAs well as I could make out, she had come for good, and had no intention of ever\\ngoing again. She began to 'help' my mother next morning, and was in and out ofthe store-closet all day, putting things to rights, and making havoc in the oldarrangements. Almost the first remarkable thing I observed in Miss Murdstone was,her being constantly haunted by a suspicion that the servants had a man secretedsomewhere on the premises. Under the influence of this delusion, she dived into thecoal-cellar at the most untimely hours, and scarcely ever opened the door of a darkcupboard without clapping it to again, in the belief that she had got him.\\nThough there was nothing very airy about Miss Murdstone, she was a perfect Lark\\nin point of getting up. She was up (and, as I believe to this hour, looking for thatman) before anybody in the house was stirring. Peggotty gave it as her opinion thatshe even slept with one eye open; but I could not concur in this idea; for I tried itmyself after hearing the suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.\\nOn the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her bell at cock-\\ncrow. When my mother came down to breakfast and was going to make the tea,Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek, which was her nearestapproach to a kiss, and said:\\n'Now, Clara, my dear, I am come here, you know, to relieve you of all the trouble I\\ncan. You're much too pretty and thoughtless'—my mother blushed but laughed, andseemed not to dislike this character—'to have any duties imposed upon you thatcan be undertaken by me. If you'll be so good as give me your keys, my dear, I'llattend to all this sort of thing in future.'\\nFrom that time, Miss Murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all day, and\\nunder her pillow all night, and my mother had no more to do with them than I had.\\nMy mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow  of\\nprotest.

'Clara! I wonder at you.''Oh, it's very well to say you wonder, Edward!' cried my mother, 'and it's very well\\nfor you to talk about firmness, but you wouldn't like it yourself.'\\nFirmness, I may observe, was the grand quality on which both Mr. and Miss\\nMurdstone took their stand. However I might have expressed my comprehension ofit at that time, if I had been called upon, I nevertheless did clearly comprehend inmy own way, that it was another name for tyranny; and for a certain  gloomy,arrogant, devil's humour, that was in them both. The creed, as I should state it now,was this. Mr. Murdstone was firm; nobody in his world was to be so firm as Mr.Murdstone; nobody else in his world was to be firm at all, for everybody was to bebent to his firmness. Miss Murdstone was an exception. She might be  firm,  butonly by relationship, and in an inferior and tributary degree. My mother wasanother exception. She might be firm, and must be; but only in bearing theirfirmness, and firmly believing there was no other firmness upon earth.\\n'It's very hard,' said my mother, 'that in my own house—''My own house?' repeated Mr. Murdstone. 'Clara!''OUR own house, I mean,' faltered my mother, evidently frightened—'I hope you\\nmust know what I mean, Edward—it's very hard that in YOUR own house I maynot have a word to say about domestic matters.

I should be very miserable and  unhappy  ifanybody was to go. I don't ask much. I am not unreasonable. I  only  want  to  beconsulted sometimes. I am very much obliged to anybody who assists me, and Ionly want to be consulted as a mere form, sometimes.

I was so sorry\\nfor my mother's distress; but I groped my way out, and groped my way up to  myroom in the dark, without even having the heart to say good night to Peggotty, or toget a candle from her. When her coming up to look for me, an hour or  soafterwards, awoke me, she said that my mother had gone to bed poorly, and thatMr. and Miss Murdstone were sitting alone.\\nGoing down next morning rather earlier than usual, I paused outside  the  parlour\\ndoor, on hearing my mother's voice. She was very earnestly and humbly entreatingMiss Murdstone's pardon, which that lady granted, and a perfect reconciliation tookplace. I never knew my mother afterwards to give an opinion on any matter,without first appealing to Miss Murdstone, or without having first ascertained bysome sure means, what Miss Murdstone's opinion was; and I never saw MissMurdstone, when out of temper (she was infirm that way), move her hand towardsher bag as if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them  to mymother, without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright.\\nThe gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the Murdstone\\nreligion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought, since, that its assumingthat character was a necessary consequence of Mr. Murdstone's firmness, whichwouldn't allow him to let anybody off from the utmost weight of the  severestpenalties he could find any excuse for.

Again, if I move a finger or relax a muscle of my face,Miss Murdstone pokes me with her prayer-book, and makes my side ache.\\nYes, and again, as we walk home, I note some neighbours looking at my mother\\nand at me, and whispering.

Again, I wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind, as I do,how we used to walk home together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that,all the dreary dismal day.\\nThere had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school. Mr. and\\nMiss Murdstone had originated it, and my mother had of course agreed with them.Nothing, however, was concluded on the subject yet. In the meantime, I learntlessons at home. Shall I ever forget those lessons! They were presided overnominally by my mother, but really by Mr. Murdstone and his sister,  who  werealways present, and found them a favourable occasion for giving my motherlessons in that miscalled firmness, which was the bane of both our lives. I believe Iwas kept at home for that purpose. I had been apt enough to learn,  and  willingenough, when my mother and I had lived alone together. I can faintly rememberlearning the alphabet at her knee. To this day, when I look upon the fat blackletters in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their shapes, and the easy good-natureof O and Q and S, seem to present themselves again before me as they used to do.But they recall no feeling of disgust or reluctance. On the contrary, I seem to havewalked along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book, and to have beencheered by the gentleness of my mother\\'s voice and manner all the way. But thesesolemn lessons which succeeded those, I remember as the death-blow of my peace,and a grievous daily drudgery and misery. They were very long, very numerous,very hard—perfectly unintelligible, some of them, to me—and I was generally asmuch bewildered by them as I believe my poor mother was herself.\\nLet me remember how it used to be, and bring one morning back again.I come into the second-best parlour after breakfast, with my books, and an\\nexercise-book, and a slate. My mother is ready for me at her writing-desk, but nothalf so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his easy-chair by the window (though  hepretends to be reading a book), or as Miss Murdstone, sitting near my motherstringing steel beads. The very sight of these two has such an influence over me,that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite pains to get into my head, allsliding away, and going I don\\'t know where. I wonder where they do go, by the by?\\nI hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps it is a grammar, perhaps a history, or\\ngeography. I take a last drowning look at the page as I give it into her hand, andstart off aloud at a racing pace while I have got it fresh. I trip over a word. Mr.Murdstone looks up. I trip over another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden,tumble over half-a-dozen words, and stop. I think my mother would show  me thebook if she dared, but she does not dare, and she says softly:\\n\\'Oh, Davy, Davy!\\'\\'Now, Clara,\\' says Mr. Murdstone, \\'be firm with the boy. Don\\'t say, \"Oh,  Davy,'),\n",

Now,\\nDavy, try once more, and don\\'t be stupid.\\'\\nI obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more, but am not so\\nsuccessful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down before I get to theold place, at a point where I was all right before, and stop to think. But I can\\'t thinkabout the lesson. I think of the number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone\\'s cap, orof the price of Mr. Murdstone\\'s dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem thatI have no business with, and don\\'t want to have anything at all to  do with.  Mr.Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been expecting  for  along time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother glances submissively  atthem, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my othertasks are done.\\nThere is a pile of these arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling snowball. The\\nbigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so hopeless, and I feel that  I amwallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that I give up all idea of  getting  out,  andabandon myself to my fate. The despairing way in which my mother and I look ateach other, as I blunder on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect  in  thesemiserable lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries togive me the cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who hasbeen lying in wait for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice:\\n\\'Clara!\\'My mother starts, colours, and smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes out of his\\nchair, takes the book, throws it at me or boxes my ears with it, and turns me out ofthe room by the shoulders.\\nEven when the lessons are done, the worst is yet to happen, in the shape  of  an\\nappalling sum. This is invented for me, and delivered to me orally by Mr.Murdstone, and begins, \\'If I go into a cheesemonger\\'s shop, and buy five thousanddouble-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each, present payment\\'—atwhich I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed. I pore over these cheeses withoutany result or enlightenment until dinner-time, when, having made a Mulatto ofmyself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores of my skin, I have a slice ofbread to help me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace for the rest ofthe evening.\\nIt seems to me, at this distance of time, as if my unfortunate studies generally took\\nthis course. I could have done very well if I had been without the Murdstones; butthe influence of the Murdstones upon me was like the fascination of two snakes ona wretched young bird. Even when I did get through the morning  with  tolerablecredit, there was not much gained but dinner; for Miss Murdstone never  couldendure to see me untasked, and if I rashly made any show of being unemployed,called her brother\\'s attention to me by saying, \\'Clara, my dear, there\\'s nothing likework—give your boy an exercise\\'; which caused me to be clapped down to somenew labour, there and then.

I was not made the less so by mysense of being daily more and more shut out and alienated from my mother. Ibelieve I should have been almost stupefied but for one circumstance.\\nIt was this. My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs,\\nto which I had access (for it adjoined my own) and which nobody else in our houseever troubled. From that blessed little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle,Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, the Vicar of Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, andRobinson Crusoe, came out, a glorious host, to keep me company. They kept alivemy fancy, and my hope of something beyond that place and time,—they,  and theArabian Nights, and the Tales of the Genii,—and did me no harm;  for  whateverharm was in some of them was not there for me; I knew nothing of it. It isastonishing to me now, how I found time, in the midst of my porings andblunderings over heavier themes, to read those books as I did. It is curious to mehow I could ever have consoled myself under my small troubles (which were greattroubles to me), by impersonating my favourite characters in them—as I did—andby putting Mr. and Miss Murdstone into all the bad ones—which I did too. I havebeen Tom Jones (a child's Tom Jones, a harmless creature) for a week together. Ihave sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verilybelieve. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of Voyages and Travels—I forgetwhat, now—that were on those shelves; and for days and days I can remember tohave gone about my region of our house, armed with the centre-piece out of an oldset of boot-trees—the perfect realization of Captain Somebody, of the RoyalBritish Navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and resolved to sell his life at agreat price. The Captain never lost dignity, from having his ears boxed  with  theLatin Grammar. I did; but the Captain was a Captain and a hero, in despite of allthe grammars of all the languages in the world, dead or alive.\\nThis was my only and my constant comfort. When I think of it, the picture always\\nrises in my mind, of a summer evening, the boys at play in the churchyard, and Isitting on my bed, reading as if for life. Every barn in the neighbourhood, everystone in the church, and every foot of the churchyard, had some association of itsown, in my mind, connected with these books, and stood for some locality madefamous in them. I have seen Tom Pipes go climbing up the church-steeple; I havewatched Strap, with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest  himself  upon thewicket-gate; and I know that Commodore Trunnion held that club with Mr. Pickle,in the parlour of our little village alehouse.\\nThe reader now understands, as well as I do, what I was when I came to that point\\nof my youthful history to which I am now coming again.\\nOne morning when I went into the parlour with my books, I found my  mother\\nlooking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr. Murdstone bindingsomething round the bottom of a cane—a lithe and limber cane, which he left offbinding when I came in, and poised and switched in the air.\\n'I tell you, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone, 'I have been often flogged myself.''To be sure; of course,' said Miss Murdstone.'Certainly, my dear Jane,' faltered my mother, meekly.

He gave the cane another poise, and another switch;and having finished his preparation of it, laid it down beside him, with animpressive look, and took up his book.\\nThis was a good freshener to my presence of mind, as a beginning. I felt the words\\nof my lessons slipping off, not one by one, or line by line, but by the entire page; Itried to lay hold of them; but they seemed, if I may so express it, to have put skateson, and to skim away from me with a smoothness there was no checking.\\nWe began badly, and went on worse. I had come in with an idea of distinguishing\\nmyself rather, conceiving that I was very well prepared; but it turned out to be quitea mistake. Book after book was added to the heap of failures, Miss Murdstonebeing firmly watchful of us all the time. And when we came at last to the  fivethousand cheeses (canes he made it that day, I remember), my mother  burst outcrying.\\n'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning voice.'I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,' said my mother.I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he rose and said, taking up the cane:'Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear, with perfect firmness, the worry\\nand torment that David has occasioned her today. That would be stoical. Clara isgreatly strengthened and improved, but we can hardly expect so much from her.David, you and I will go upstairs, boy.'\\nAs he took me out at the door, my mother ran towards us. Miss Murdstone said,\\n'Clara! are you a perfect fool?' and interfered. I saw my mother stop her ears then,and I heard her crying.\\nHe walked me up to my room slowly and gravely—I am certain he had a delight in\\nthat formal parade of executing justice—and when we got there, suddenly twistedmy head under his arm.\\n'Mr. Murdstone! Sir!' I cried to him. 'Don't! Pray don't beat me! I have  tried  to\\nlearn, sir, but I can't learn while you and Miss Murdstone are by. I can't indeed!'\\n'Can't you, indeed, David?' he said. 'We'll try that.'He had my head as in a vice, but I twined round him somehow, and stopped him\\nfor a moment, entreating him not to beat me. It was only a moment that I stoppedhim, for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards, and in the same instant I caughtthe hand with which he held me in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through.It sets my teeth on edge to think of it.\\nHe beat me then, as if he would have beaten me to death.

How well I remember, when my smart and passionbegan to cool, how wicked I began to feel!\\nI sat listening for a long while, but there was not a sound. I crawled up from  the\\nfloor, and saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and ugly that it almostfrightened me. My stripes were sore and stiff, and made me cry afresh, when  Imoved; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt. It lay heavier on my breast than if Ihad been a most atrocious criminal, I dare say.\\nIt had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the window (I had been lying, for the\\nmost part, with my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing, and lookinglistlessly out), when the key was turned, and Miss Murdstone came in with somebread and meat, and milk. These she put down upon the table without a word,glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness, and then retired, locking the doorafter her.\\nLong after it was dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else would come.\\nWhen this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed, and went to bed; and,there, I began to wonder fearfully what would be done to me. Whether it was acriminal act that I had committed? Whether I should be taken into  custody,  andsent to prison? Whether I was at all in danger of being hanged?\\nI never shall forget the waking, next morning; the being cheerful and fresh for the\\nfirst moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale and dismal oppressionof remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared before I was out of bed; told me, inso many words, that I was free to walk in the garden for half an hour and nolonger; and retired, leaving the door open, that I might avail myself of thatpermission.\\nI did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five days. If I\\ncould have seen my mother alone, I should have gone down on my knees to herand besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss Murdstone excepted, duringthe whole time—except at evening prayers in the parlour; to which I was escortedby Miss Murdstone after everybody else was placed; where I was stationed, ayoung outlaw, all alone by myself near the door; and whence I was solemnlyconducted by my jailer, before any one arose from the devotional posture. I onlyobserved that my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept her faceanother way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. Murdstone's hand was bound up ina large linen wrapper.\\nThe length of those five days I can convey no idea of to any one. They occupy the\\nplace of years in my remembrance.

On the last night of my restraint, I was awakened byhearing my own name spoken in a whisper. I started up in bed, and putting out myarms in the dark, said:\\n'Is that you, Peggotty?'There was no immediate answer, but presently I heard my name again, in a tone so\\nvery mysterious and awful, that I think I should have gone into a fit, if it had notoccurred to me that it must have come through the keyhole.\\nI groped my way to the door, and putting my own lips to the keyhole, whispered:\\n'Is that you, Peggotty dear?'\\n'Yes, my own precious Davy,' she replied. 'Be as soft as a mouse, or the Cat'll hear\\nus.'\\nI understood this to mean Miss Murdstone, and was sensible of the urgency of the\\ncase; her room being close by.\\n'How's mama, dear Peggotty? Is she very angry with me?'I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole, as I was doing on\\nmine, before she answered. 'No. Not very.'\\n'What is going to be done with me, Peggotty dear? Do you know?''School. Near London,' was Peggotty's answer. I was obliged to get her to repeat it,\\nfor she spoke it the first time quite down my throat, in consequence of my havingforgotten to take my mouth away from the keyhole and put my ear there; andthough her words tickled me a good deal, I didn't hear them.\\n'When, Peggotty?''Tomorrow.''Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took the clothes out of my drawers?' which\\nshe had done, though I have forgotten to mention it.\\n'Yes,' said Peggotty.

Will you, if you please, Peggotty?'\\nThe kind soul promised, and we both of us kissed the keyhole with  the  greatest\\naffection—I patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had been her honest face—and parted. From that night there grew up in my breast a feeling for Peggotty whichI cannot very well define. She did not replace my mother; no one could do that; butshe came into a vacancy in my heart, which closed upon her, and I felt towards hersomething I have never felt for any other human being. It was a sort of comicalaffection, too; and yet if she had died, I cannot think what I should have done, orhow I should have acted out the tragedy it would have been to me.\\nIn the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as usual, and told me I was going  to\\nschool; which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed. She alsoinformed me that when I was dressed, I was to come downstairs into the parlour,and have my breakfast. There, I found my mother, very pale and with red eyes:into whose arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my suffering soul.\\n'Oh, Davy!' she said. 'That you could hurt anyone I love! Try to be better, pray to\\nbe better! I forgive you; but I am so grieved, Davy, that you should have such badpassions in your heart.'\\nThey had persuaded her that I was a wicked fellow, and she was more sorry for that\\nthan for my going away. I felt it sorely. I tried to eat my parting breakfast, but mytears dropped upon my bread-and-butter, and trickled into my tea. I saw my motherlook at me sometimes, and then glance at the watchful Miss Murdstone, and thanlook down, or look away.\\n'Master Copperfield's box there!' said Miss Murdstone, when wheels were heard at\\nthe gate.\\nI looked for Peggotty, but it was not she; neither she nor Mr. Murdstone appeared.\\nMy former acquaintance, the carrier, was at the door. The box was taken out to hiscart, and lifted in.\\n'Clara!' said Miss Murdstone, in her warning note.'Ready, my dear Jane,' returned my mother. 'Good-bye, Davy. You are going for\\nyour own good. Good-bye, my child. You will come home in the holidays, and bea better boy.'\\n'Clara!' Miss Murdstone repeated.'Certainly, my dear Jane,' replied my mother, who was holding me.

I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME\\nWe might have gone about half a mile, and my pocket-handkerchief was quite wetthrough, when the carrier stopped short. Looking out to ascertain for what, I saw, toMY amazement, Peggotty burst from a hedge and climb into the cart. She took mein both her arms, and squeezed me to her stays until the pressure on my nose wasextremely painful, though I never thought of that till afterwards when I  found  itvery tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak. Releasing one of her arms, sheput it down in her pocket to the elbow, and brought out some paper bags of cakeswhich she crammed into my pockets, and a purse which she put into my hand, butnot one word did she say. After another and a final squeeze with both arms, she gotdown from the cart and ran away; and, my belief is, and has always been, withouta solitary button on her gown. I picked up one, of several that  were rolling about,and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.\\nThe carrier looked at me, as if to inquire if she were coming back.  I  shook  my\\nhead, and said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said the carrier to the lazy horse; whocame up accordingly.\\nHaving by this time cried as much as I possibly could, I began to think it was of no\\nuse crying any more, especially as neither Roderick Random, nor that Captain inthe Royal British Navy, had ever cried, that I could remember, in trying situations.The carrier, seeing me in this resolution, proposed that my pocket-handkerchiefshould be spread upon the horse's back to dry. I thanked him, and assented; andparticularly small it looked, under those circumstances.\\nI had now leisure to examine the purse. It was a stiff leather purse, with a snap, and\\nhad three bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had evidently polished up withwhitening, for my greater delight. But its most precious contents were  two half -crowns folded together in a bit of paper, on which was written, in my  mother'shand, 'For Davy. With my love.' I was so overcome by this, that I asked the carrierto be so good as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again; but he said he thoughtI had better do without it, and I thought I really had, so I wiped my eyes on mysleeve and stopped myself.\\nFor good, too; though, in consequence of my previous emotions, I was still\\noccasionally seized with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for some little time,I asked the carrier if he was going all the way.\\n'All the way where?' inquired the carrier.'There,' I said.'Where's there?' inquired the carrier.\"),\n",

I asked.'That's about it,' said the carrier. 'And there I shall take you to the stage-cutch, and\\nthe stage-cutch that'll take you to—wherever it is.'\\nAs this was a great deal for the carrier (whose name was Mr. Barkis) to say—he\\nbeing, as I observed in a former chapter, of a phlegmatic temperament, and not atall conversational—I offered him a cake as a mark of attention, which he ate at onegulp, exactly like an elephant, and which made no more impression on his big facethan it would have done on an elephant's.\\n'Did SHE make 'em, now?' said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, in his\\nslouching way, on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee.\\n'Peggotty, do you mean, sir?''Ah!' said Mr. Barkis. 'Her.''Yes. She makes all our pastry, and does all our cooking.''Do she though?' said Mr. Barkis. He made up his mouth as if to whistle, but he\\ndidn't whistle. He sat looking at the horse's ears, as if he saw something new there;and sat so, for a considerable time. By and by, he said:\\n'No sweethearts, I b'lieve?''Sweetmeats did you say, Mr. Barkis?' For I thought he wanted something else to\\neat, and had pointedly alluded to that description of refreshment.\\n'Hearts,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Sweet hearts; no person walks with her!''With Peggotty?''Ah!' he said. 'Her.''Oh, no. She never had a sweetheart.''Didn't she, though!' said Mr. Barkis.Again he made up his mouth to whistle, and again he didn't whistle, but sat looking\\nat the horse's ears.\\n'So she makes,' said Mr. Barkis, after a long interval of reflection, 'all  the  apple\\nparsties, and doos all the cooking, do she?'\\nI replied that such was the fact.'Well. I'll tell you what,' said Mr. Barkis. 'P'raps you might be writin' to her?''I shall certainly write to her,' I rejoined.'Ah!' he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. 'Well! If you was writin' to her,\\np'raps you'd recollect to say that Barkis was willin'; would you?'\\n'That Barkis is willing,' I repeated, innocently.

While I was waiting  forthe coach in the hotel at Yarmouth that very afternoon, I procured a sheet of paperand an inkstand, and wrote a note to Peggotty, which ran thus: 'My dear Peggotty.I have come here safe. Barkis is willing. My love to mama. Yours affectionately.P.S. He says he particularly wants you to know—BARKIS IS WILLING.'\\nWhen I had taken this commission on myself prospectively, Mr. Barkis relapsed\\ninto perfect silence; and I, feeling quite worn out by all that had happened lately,lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep. I slept soundly until we got toYarmouth; which was so entirely new and strange to me in the inn-yard to whichwe drove, that I at once abandoned a latent hope I had had of meeting with someof Mr. Peggotty's family there, perhaps even with little Em'ly herself.\\nThe coach was in the yard, shining very much all over, but without any horses to it\\nas yet; and it looked in that state as if nothing was more unlikely than its ever goingto London. I was thinking this, and wondering what would ultimately become ofmy box, which Mr. Barkis had put down on the yard-pavement by the  pole  (hehaving driven up the yard to turn his cart), and also what would ultimately becomeof me, when a lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints ofmeat were hanging up, and said:\\n'Is that the little gentleman from Blunderstone?''Yes, ma'am,' I said.'What name?' inquired the lady.'Copperfield, ma'am,' I said.'That won't do,' returned the lady. 'Nobody's dinner is paid for here, in that name.''Is it Murdstone, ma'am?' I said.'If you're Master Murdstone,' said the lady, 'why do you go and give another name,\\nfirst?'\\nI explained to the lady how it was, who than rang a bell, and called out, 'William!\\nshow the coffee-room!' upon which a waiter came running out of a kitchen on theopposite side of the yard to show it, and seemed a good deal surprised when he wasonly to show it to me.\\nIt was a large long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I could have felt\\nmuch stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and I cast away in themiddle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to sit down, with my cap in my hand,on the corner of the chair nearest the door; and when the waiter laid a  cloth  onpurpose for me, and put a set of castors on it, I think I must have turned red allover with modesty.\\nHe brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in such a\\nbouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some  offence.

After watching meinto the second chop, he said:\\n'There's half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?'I thanked him and said, 'Yes.' Upon which he poured it out of a jug into a large\\ntumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look beautiful.\\n'My eye!' he said. 'It seems a good deal, don't it?''It does seem a good deal,' I answered with a smile. For it was quite  delightful to\\nme, to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed, pimple-faced man, with hishair standing upright all over his head; and as he stood with one arm  a -kimbo,holding up the glass to the light with the other hand, he looked quite friendly.\\n'There was a gentleman here, yesterday,' he said—'a stout gentleman, by the name\\nof Topsawyer—perhaps you know him?'\\n'No,' I said, 'I don't think—''In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled choker,' said the\\nwaiter.\\n'No,' I said bashfully, 'I haven't the pleasure—''He came in here,' said the waiter, looking at the light through the tumbler, 'ordered\\na glass of this ale—WOULD order it—I told him not—drank it, and fell dead.

He not only brought it immediately,but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the letter.

My unfortunate friend the waiter, who had quite recovered hisspirits, did not appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admirationwithout being at all confused.

The story of my supposed appetite getting wind among the outsidepassengers, they were merry upon it likewise; and asked me whether I was going tobe paid for, at school, as two brothers or three, and whether I was contracted for, orwent upon the regular terms; with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it was,that I knew I should be ashamed to eat anything, when an opportunity offered, andthat, after a rather light dinner, I should remain hungry all night—for I had left mycakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My apprehensions were realized. When westopped for supper I couldn't muster courage to take any, though I should haveliked it very much, but sat by the fire and said I didn't want anything. This did notsave me from more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced gentleman with a rough face,who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the way, except when he hadbeen drinking out of a bottle, said I was like a boa-constrictor who took enough atone meal to last him a long time; after which, he actually brought a rash out uponhimself with boiled beef.\\nWe had started from Yarmouth at three o'clock in the afternoon, and we were due\\nin London about eight next morning. It was Mid-summer weather, and the eveningwas very pleasant. When we passed through a village, I pictured to myself what theinsides of the houses were like, and what the inhabitants were about;  and  whenboys came running after us, and got up behind and swung there for a little way, Iwondered whether their fathers were alive, and whether they Were happy at home.I had plenty to think of, therefore, besides my mind running continually on the kindof place I was going to—which was an awful speculation. Sometimes, I remember,I resigned myself to thoughts of home and Peggotty; and to endeavouring, in  aconfused blind way, to recall how I had felt, and what sort of boy I used to be,before I bit Mr. Murdstone: which I couldn't satisfy myself about by any  means, Iseemed to have bitten him in such a remote antiquity.\"),\n",

The\\ndifficulties under which they had laboured all night, and which had found utterancein the most terrific gasps and snorts, are not to be conceived.

Here, as I sat looking at the parcels, packages, and books, and inhalingthe smell of stables (ever since associated with that morning), a procession of mosttremendous considerations began to march through my mind. Supposing nobodyshould ever fetch me, how long would they consent to keep me there? Would theykeep me long enough to spend seven shillings? Should I sleep at night in one ofthose wooden bins, with the other luggage, and wash myself at the pump  in  theyard in the morning; or should I be turned out every night, and expected to comeagain to be left till called for, when the office opened next day? Supposing therewas no mistake in the case, and Mr. Murdstone had devised this plan to get rid ofme, what should I do? If they allowed me to remain there until my seven shillingswere spent, I couldn't hope to remain there when I began to starve.  That  wouldobviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the customers, besides entailing on theBlue Whatever-it-was, the risk of funeral expenses.

If Ifound out the nearest proper authorities, and offered myself to go for a soldier, or asailor, I was such a little fellow that it was most likely they wouldn't take me in.These thoughts, and a hundred other such thoughts, turned me burning hot,  andmade me giddy with apprehension and dismay.

He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow cheeks, and a chin almostas black as Mr. Murdstone's; but there the likeness ended, for his whiskers wereshaved off, and his hair, instead of being glossy, was rusty and dry. He was dressedin a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short inthe sleeves and legs; and he had a white neck-kerchief on, that was not over-clean.I did not, and do not, suppose that this neck-kerchief was all the linen he wore, butit was all he showed or gave any hint of.\\n'You're the new boy?' he said.

Heappeared surprised at this—I see him stop and look at me now—and afterconsidering for a few moments, said he wanted to call on an old person who livednot far off, and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread, or whatever Iliked best that was wholesome, and make my breakfast at her house, where wecould get some milk.\\nAccordingly we looked in at a baker's window, and after I had made a series of\\nproposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and he had rejected themone by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread, which costme threepence. Then, at a grocer's shop, we bought an egg and a slice of streakybacon; which still left what I thought a good deal of change, out of the second ofthe bright shillings, and made me consider London a very cheap place. Theseprovisions laid in, we went on through a great noise and uproar that  confused myweary head beyond description, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was LondonBridge (indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to thepoor person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew  by theirlook, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they wereestablished for twenty-five poor women.\\nThe Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little black doors\\nthat were all alike, and had each a little diamond -paned window on one  side, andanother little diamond—paned window above; and we went into the little house ofone of these poor old women, who was blowing a fire to make a little saucepanboil. On seeing the master enter, the old woman stopped with the bellows on herknee, and said something that I thought sounded like 'My Charley!' but on seeingme come in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of  halfcurtsey.\\n'Can you cook this young gentleman's breakfast for him, if you please ?' said  the\\nMaster at Salem House.\\n'Can I?' said the old woman.

The sun streamed in at thelittle window, but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chairtowards it, screening the fire as if she were sedulously keeping IT warm, instead ofit keeping her warm, and watching it in a most distrustful manner.

While I was yet in the full enjoyment ofit, the old woman of the house said to the Master:\\n'Have you got your flute with you?''Yes,' he returned.'Have a blow at it,' said the old woman, coaxingly. 'Do!'The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat, and brought\\nout his flute in three pieces, which he screwed together, and began immediately toplay. My impression is, after many years of consideration, that there never canhave been anybody in the world who played worse. He made the most dismalsounds I have ever heard produced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't knowwhat the tunes were—if there were such things in the performance at all,  which Idoubt—but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me think of allmy sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to take away my appetite;and lastly, to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep my eyes open. They begin toclose again, and I begin to nod, as the recollection rises fresh upon me. Once morethe little room, with its open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and itsangular little staircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's feathersdisplayed over the mantelpiece—I remember wondering when I first went in, whatthat peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed tocome to—fades from before me, and I nod, and sleep. The flute becomes inaudible,the wheels of the coach are heard instead, and I am on my journey.

I was in the middle statebetween sleeping and waking, either then or immediately afterwards; for, as heresumed—it was a real fact that he had stopped playing—I saw and heard the sameold woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson if it wasn't delicious (meaning the flute), to whichMrs. Fibbitson replied, 'Ay, ay! yes!' and nodded at the fire: to which, I ampersuaded, she gave the credit of the whole performance.\\nWhen I seemed to have been dozing a long while, the Master at Salem House\\nunscrewed his flute into the three pieces, put them up as before, and took me away.We found the coach very near at hand, and got upon the roof; but I was so deadsleepy, that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else, they put meinside where there were no passengers, and where I slept profoundly, until I foundthe coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green leaves.

I observed then, for the first time, that the boots he had on were a gooddeal the worse for wear, and that his stocking was just breaking out in one place,like a bud.\\nSalem House was a square brick building with wings; of a bare and unfurnished\\nappearance. All about it was so very quiet, that I said to Mr. Mell I supposed theboys were out; but he seemed surprised at my not knowing that it was holiday-time.That all the boys were at their several homes. That Mr. Creakle, the proprietor, wasdown by the sea-side with Mrs. and Miss Creakle; and that  I was sent in holiday -time as a punishment for my misdoing, all of which he explained to me as we wentalong.\\nI gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me, as the most forlorn  and\\ndesolate place I had ever seen. I see it now. A long room with three long rows ofdesks, and six of forms, and bristling all round with pegs for hats and slates. Scrapsof old copy-books and exercises litter the dirty floor. Some silkworms' houses,made of the same materials, are scattered over the desks. Two miserable little whitemice, left behind by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made ofpasteboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything  toeat. A bird, in a cage very little bigger than himself,  makes a mournful rattle nowand then in hopping on his perch, two inches high, or dropping from it; but neithersings nor chirps. There is a strange unwholesome smell upon the room, likemildewed corduroys, sweet apples wanting air, and rotten books. There could notwell be more ink splashed about it, if it had been roofless from its firstconstruction, and the skies had rained, snowed, hailed, and blown ink  through thevarying seasons of the year.\\nMr. Mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs, I went softly\\nto the upper end of the room, observing all this as I crept along.

HE BITES.'\\nI got upon the desk immediately, apprehensive of at least a great dog underneath.\\nBut, though I looked all round with anxious eyes, I could see nothing of him.

He was in authority; and if he ever saw me leaning against a tree, or awall, or the house, he roared out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice, 'Hallo,you sir! You Copperfield! Show that badge conspicuous, or I'll report  you!'  Theplayground was a bare gravelled yard, open to all the back of the house and theoffices; and I knew that the servants read it, and the butcher read it, and the bakerread it; that everybody, in a word, who came backwards and forwards to the house,of a morning when I was ordered to walk there, read that I was to be taken care of,for I bit, I recollect that I positively began to have a dread of myself, as a kind ofwild boy who did bite.\\nThere was an old door in this playground, on which the boys had a custom  of\\ncarving their names. It was completely covered with such inscriptions. In my dreadof the end of the vacation and their coming back, I could not read a boy's name,without inquiring in what tone and with what emphasis HE would read, 'Take careof him. He bites.' There was one boy—a certain J. Steerforth—who cut his namevery deep and very often, who, I conceived, would read it in a rather strong voice,and afterwards pull my hair. There was another boy, one Tommy Traddles, who Idreaded would make game of it, and pretend to be dreadfully frightened of  me.There was a third, George Demple, who I fancied would sing it. I have looked, alittle shrinking creature, at that door, until the owners of all the names—there werefive-and-forty of them in the school then, Mr. Mell said—seemed to send me toCoventry by general acclamation, and to cry out, each in his own way, 'Take careof him. He bites!'\\nIt was the same with the places at the desks and forms. It was the same with the\\ngroves of deserted bedsteads I peeped at, on my way to, and when I was in, myown bed.

He was bald on the top of his head; and had some thinwet-looking hair that was just turning grey, brushed across each temple, so that thetwo sides interlaced on his forehead. But the circumstance about him whichimpressed me most, was, that he had no voice, but spoke in a whisper. The exertionthis cost him, or the consciousness of talking in that feeble way, made his angryface so much more angry, and his thick veins so much thicker, when he spoke, thatI am not surprised, on looking back, at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one.'Now,' said Mr. Creakle. 'What's the report of this boy?'\\n'There's nothing against him yet,' returned the man with the wooden leg. 'There has\\nbeen no opportunity.'\\nI thought Mr. Creakle was disappointed. I thought Mrs. and Miss Creakle (at whom\\nI now glanced for the first time, and who were, both, thin and quiet) were notdisappointed.\\n'Come here, sir!' said Mr. Creakle, beckoning to me.'Come here!' said the man with the wooden leg, repeating the gesture.'I have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law,' whispered Mr. Creakle,\\ntaking me by the ear; 'and a worthy man he is, and a man of a strong character. Heknows me, and I know him. Do YOU know me? Hey?' said Mr. Creakle, pinchingmy ear with ferocious playfulness.\\n'Not yet, sir,' I said, flinching with the pain.'Not yet? Hey?' repeated Mr. Creakle. 'But you will soon. Hey?''You will soon. Hey?' repeated the man with the wooden leg. I afterwards found\\nthat he generally acted, with his strong voice, as Mr. Creakle's interpreter  to  theboys.\\nI was very much frightened, and said, I hoped so, if he pleased. I felt, all this while,\\nas if my ear were blazing; he pinched it so hard.\\n'I'll tell you what I am,' whispered Mr. Creakle, letting it go at last, with a screw at\\nparting that brought the water into my eyes. 'I'm a Tartar.'\\n'A Tartar,' said the man with the wooden leg.'When I say I'll do a thing, I do it,' said Mr. Creakle; 'and when I say I will have a\\nthing done, I will have it done.'\"),\n",

Mr. Sharp was the first master, and superior\\nto Mr. Mell. Mr. Mell took his meals with the boys, but Mr. Sharp dined andsupped at Mr. Creakle's table. He was a limp, delicate-looking gentleman, Ithought, with a good deal of nose, and a way of carrying his head on one side, as ifit were a little too heavy for him. His hair was very smooth and wavy; but I wasinformed by the very first boy who came back that it was a wig (a second-hand oneHE said), and that Mr. Sharp went out every Saturday afternoon to get it curled.\\nIt was no other than Tommy Traddles who gave me this piece of intelligence. He\\nwas the first boy who returned. He introduced himself by informing me that  Ishould find his name on the right-hand corner of the gate, over the top-bolt; uponthat I said, 'Traddles?' to which he replied, 'The same,' and then he asked me for afull account of myself and family.\\nIt was a happy circumstance for me that Traddles came back first. He enjoyed my\\nplacard so much, that he saved me from the embarrassment of either disclosure orconcealment, by presenting me to every other boy who came back, great or small,immediately on his arrival, in this form of introduction, 'Look here! Here's a game!'Happily, too, the greater part of the boys came back low-spirited, and were not soboisterous at my expense as I had expected. Some of them certainly did danceabout me like wild Indians, and the greater part could not resist the temptation ofpretending that I was a dog, and patting and soothing me, lest I should bite,  andsaying, 'Lie down, sir!' and calling me Towzer.

A certain mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness,the secrecy of the revel, and the whisper in which everything was said, steals overme again, and I listen to all they tell me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe,which makes me glad that they are all so near, and frightens me (though I feign tolaugh) when Traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner.\\nI heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it. I heard that Mr.\\nCreakle had not preferred his claim to being a Tartar without reason; that  he wasthe sternest and most severe of masters; that he laid about him, right and left, everyday of his life, charging in among the boys like a trooper, and slashing away,unmercifully. That he knew nothing himself, but the art of slashing, being  moreignorant (J. Steerforth said) than the lowest boy in the school; that  he had been, agood many years ago, a small hop-dealer in the Borough, and had taken to  theschooling business after being bankrupt in hops, and making away with  Mrs.Creakle's money. With a good deal more of that sort, which  I wondered how theyknew.\\nI heard that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was Tungay, was an\\nobstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business, but had comeinto the scholastic line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence, as was supposed amongthe boys, of his having broken his leg in Mr. Creakle's service, and having done adeal of dishonest work for him, and knowing his secrets. I heard that with thesingle exception of Mr. Creakle, Tungay considered the whole establishment,masters and boys, as his natural enemies, and that the only delight of his life was tobe sour and malicious. I heard that Mr. Creakle had a son, who had not beenTungay's friend, and who, assisting in the school, had once held someremonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very cruellyexercised, and was supposed, besides, to have protested against his father's usageof his mother. I heard that Mr. Creakle had turned him out of doors, inconsequence; and that Mrs. and Miss Creakle had been in a sad way, ever since.\\nBut the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr. Creakle was, there being one boy in the\\nschool on whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that boy being J. Steerforth.Steerforth himself confirmed this when it was stated, and said that he should like tobegin to see him do it. On being asked by a mild boy (not me) how he  wouldproceed if he did begin to see him do it, he dipped a match into his phosphorus-boxon purpose to shed a glare over his reply, and said he would commence  byknocking him down with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle that was always on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some time,breathless.\\nI heard that Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell were both supposed to be wretchedly paid;\\nand that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at Mr. Creakle's table, Mr.Sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold; which was again corroboratedby J. Steerforth, the only parlour-boarder.

I heard that Miss Creaklewas regarded by the school in general as being in love with Steerforth; and I amsure, as I sat in the dark, thinking of his nice voice, and his fine face, and his easymanner, and his curling hair, I thought it very likely. I heard that Mr. Mell was nota bad sort of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to bless himself  with; and that there wasno doubt that old Mrs. Mell, his mother, was as poor as job. I thought  of  mybreakfast then, and what had sounded like 'My Charley!' but I was, I am glad toremember, as mute as a mouse about it.\\nThe hearing of all this, and a good deal more, outlasted the banquet some time.

A profound impression was made upon me,  Iremember, by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed asdeath when Mr. Creakle entered after breakfast, and stood in the doorway lookinground upon us like a giant in a story-book surveying his captives.\\nTungay stood at Mr. Creakle's elbow. He had no occasion, I thought, to  cry  out\\n'Silence!' so ferociously, for the boys were all struck speechless and motionless.\\nMr. Creakle was seen to speak, and Tungay was heard, to this effect.'Now, boys, this is a new half.

Now get to work, every boy!'\\nWhen this dreadful exordium was over, and Tungay had stumped out again, Mr.\\nCreakle came to where I sat, and told me that if I were famous for biting, he wasfamous for biting, too. He then showed me the cane, and asked me what I thoughtof THAT, for a tooth? Was it a sharp tooth, hey? Was it a double tooth, hey? Hadit a deep prong, hey? Did it bite, hey? Did it bite? At every question he gave me afleshy cut with it that made me writhe; so I was very soon made  free  of  SalemHouse (as Steerforth said), and was very soon in tears also.\\nNot that I mean to say these were special marks of distinction, which only I\\nreceived. On the contrary, a large majority of the boys (especially the smaller ones)were visited with similar instances of notice, as Mr. Creakle made the round of theschoolroom. Half the establishment was writhing and crying, before the day's workbegan; and how much of it had writhed and cried before the day's work was over, Iam really afraid to recollect, lest I should seem to exaggerate.\\nI should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his profession more\\nthan Mr. Creakle did. He had a delight in cutting at the boys, which was like  thesatisfaction of a craving appetite. I am confident that he couldn't resist a chubbyboy, especially; that there was a fascination in such a subject, which made  himrestless in his mind, until he had scored and marked him for the day. I was chubbymyself, and ought to know. I am sure when I think of the fellow now, my bloodrises against him with the disinterested indignation I should feel if I could  haveknown all about him without having ever been in his power; but it rises hotly,because I know him to have been an incapable brute, who had no more right to bepossessed of the great trust he held, than to be Lord High Admiral, or Commander-in-Chief—in either of which capacities it is probable that he would have  doneinfinitely less mischief.\\nMiserable little propitiators of a remorseless Idol, how abject we were to  him!\\nWhat a launch in life I think it now, on looking back, to be so mean and servile toa man of such parts and pretensions!\\nHere I sit at the desk again, watching his eye—humbly watching his eye,  as  he\\nrules a ciphering-book for another victim whose hands have just been flattened bythat identical ruler, and who is trying to wipe the sting out with a pocket-handkerchief. I have plenty to do. I don't watch his eye in idleness, but because Iam morbidly attracted to it, in a dread desire to know what he will do next, andwhether it will be my turn to suffer, or somebody else's. A lane of small boysbeyond me, with the same interest in his eye, watch it too. I think  he  knows  it,though he pretends he don't. He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the ciphering-book; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane, and we all  droop overour books and tremble. A moment afterwards we are again eyeing him. Anunhappy culprit, found guilty of imperfect exercise, approaches at  his  command.The culprit falters excuses, and professes a determination to do better  tomorrow.Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he beats him, and we laugh at it,—miserable littledogs, we laugh, with our visages as white as ashes, and our hearts sinking into ourboots.\\nHere I sit at the desk again, on a drowsy summer afternoon.

The window at a little distance from which I know he is having his dinner,stands for him, and I eye that instead. If he shows his face near it, mine assumes animploring and submissive expression. If he looks out through the glass, the boldestboy (Steerforth excepted) stops in the middle of a shout or yell, and  becomescontemplative. One day, Traddles (the most unfortunate boy in the world) breaksthat window accidentally, with a ball. I shudder at this moment with thetremendous sensation of seeing it done, and feeling that the ball has bounded on toMr. Creakle's sacred head.\\nPoor Traddles! In a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs like German\\nsausages, or roly-poly puddings, he was the merriest and most miserable of all theboys. He was always being caned—I think he was caned every day that half-year,except one holiday Monday when he was only ruler'd on both hands—and wasalways going to write to his uncle about it, and never did. After laying his head onthe desk for a little while, he would cheer up, somehow, begin to laugh again, anddraw skeletons all over his slate, before his eyes were dry. I used at first to wonderwhat comfort Traddles found in drawing skeletons; and for some time looked uponhim as a sort of hermit, who reminded himself by those symbols of mortality thatcaning couldn't last for ever. But I believe he only did it because they were easy,and didn't want any features.\\nHe was very honourable, Traddles was, and held it as a solemn duty in the boys to\\nstand by one another. He suffered for this on several occasions;  and  particularlyonce, when Steerforth laughed in church, and the Beadle thought it was Traddles,and took him out. I see him now, going away in custody, despised by thecongregation. He never said who was the real offender, though he smarted for itnext day, and was imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a wholechurchyard-full of skeletons swarming all over his Latin Dictionary. But he had hisreward. Steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in Traddles, and we all  feltthat to be the highest praise. For my part, I could have gone through a good deal(though I was much less brave than Traddles, and nothing like so old) to have wonsuch a recompense.\\nTo see Steerforth walk to church before us, arm-in-arm with Miss Creakle, was one\\nof the great sights of my life. I didn't think Miss Creakle equal to little Em'ly inpoint of beauty, and I didn't love her (I didn't dare); but I thought her a young ladyof extraordinary attractions, and in point of gentility not to be surpassed.  WhenSteerforth, in white trousers, carried her parasol for her, I felt proud to know him;and believed that she could not choose but adore him with all her heart. Mr. Sharpand Mr. Mell were both notable personages in my eyes; but Steerforth was to themwhat the sun was to two stars.\\nSteerforth continued his protection of me, and proved a very useful friend; since\\nnobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance. He couldn't—or at all events he didn't—defend me from Mr. Creakle, who  was  very  severewith me; but whenever I had been treated worse than usual, he always told me thatI wanted a little of his pluck, and that he wouldn't have stood it himself; which Ifelt he intended for encouragement, and considered to be very kind of him.

It happened on one occasion, when he was doing me the honourof talking to me in the playground, that I hazarded the observation that  somethingor somebody—I forget what now—was like something or somebody in PeregrinePickle. He said nothing at the time; but when I was going to bed at night, asked meif I had got that book?\\nI told him no, and explained how it was that I had read it, and all those other books\\nof which I have made mention.\\n'And do you recollect them?' Steerforth said.'Oh yes,' I replied; I had a good memory, and I believed I recollected them  very\\nwell.\\n'Then I tell you what, young Copperfield,' said Steerforth, 'you shall tell 'em to me.\\nI can't get to sleep very early at night, and I generally wake rather early in  themorning. We'll go over 'em one after another. We'll make some  regular  ArabianNights of it.'\\nI felt extremely flattered by this arrangement, and we commenced carrying it into\\nexecution that very evening. What ravages I committed on my favourite authors inthe course of my interpretation of them, I am not in a condition to say, and shouldbe very unwilling to know; but I had a profound faith in them, and I had, to thebest of my belief, a simple, earnest manner of narrating what I did  narrate;  andthese qualities went a long way.\\nThe drawback was, that I was often sleepy at night, or out of spirits and indisposed\\nto resume the story; and then it was rather hard work, and it must be done; for todisappoint or to displease Steerforth was of course out of the question. In themorning, too, when I felt weary, and should have enjoyed another  hour's  reposevery much, it was a tiresome thing to be roused, like the Sultana Scheherazade, andforced into a long story before the getting-up bell rang; but Steerforth was resolute;and as he explained to me, in return, my sums and exercises, and anything  in mytasks that was too hard for me, I was no loser by the transaction. Let me do myselfjustice, however. I was moved by no interested or selfish motive, nor was I movedby fear of him. I admired and loved him, and his approval was return enough. Itwas so precious to me that I look back on these trifles, now, with an aching heart.\\nSteerforth was considerate, too; and showed his consideration, in one particular\\ninstance, in an unflinching manner that was a little tantalizing, I suspect, to poorTraddles and the rest. Peggotty's promised letter—what a comfortable letter it was!—arrived before 'the half' was many weeks old; and with it a cake in a perfect nestof oranges, and two bottles of cowslip wine. This treasure, as in duty bound, I laidat the feet of Steerforth, and begged him to dispense.\\n'Now, I'll tell you what, young Copperfield,' said he: 'the wine shall be kept to wet\\nyour whistle when you are story-telling.'\\nI blushed at the idea, and begged him, in my modesty, not to think of it.

The institution never flagged for want of a story, I am certain; and thewine lasted out almost as well as the matter. Poor Traddles—I never think of thatboy but with a strange disposition to laugh, and with tears in my eyes—was a sortof chorus, in general; and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts,and to be overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming characterin the narrative. This rather put me out, very often. It was a great jest of  his,  Irecollect, to pretend that he couldn't keep his teeth from chattering, whenevermention was made of an Alguazill in connexion with the adventures of Gil Blas;and I remember that when Gil Blas met the captain of the robbers in Madrid, thisunlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror, that he was overheard by Mr.Creakle, who was prowling about the passage, and handsomely flogged fordisorderly conduct in the bedroom. Whatever I had within me that  was  romanticand dreamy, was encouraged by so much story-telling in the dark; and in  thatrespect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me. But the beingcherished as a kind of plaything in my room, and the consciousness that thisaccomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys, and attracted a gooddeal of notice to me though I was the youngest there, stimulated me to exertion. Ina school carried on by sheer cruelty, whether it is presided over by a dunce or not,there is not likely to be much learnt. I believe our boys were, generally, as ignoranta set as any schoolboys in existence; they were too much troubled  and  knockedabout to learn; they could no more do that to advantage, than any one  can  doanything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune, torment, and worry. But mylittle vanity, and Steerforth's help, urged me on somehow; and without saving mefrom much, if anything, in the way of punishment, made me, for the time I wasthere, an exception to the general body, insomuch that I did steadily pick up somecrumbs of knowledge.\\nIn this I was much assisted by Mr. Mell, who had a liking for me that I am grateful\\nto remember. It always gave me pain to observe that Steerforth treated him withsystematic disparagement, and seldom lost an occasion of wounding his feelings, orinducing others to do so. This troubled me the more for a long time, because I hadsoon told Steerforth, from whom I could no more keep such a secret, than I couldkeep a cake or any other tangible possession, about the two old  women Mr. Mellhad taken me to see; and I was always afraid that Steerforth would let  it out, andtwit him with it.\\nWe little thought, any one of us, I dare say, when I ate my breakfast that  first\\nmorning, and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock's feathers to the soundof the flute, what consequences would come of the introduction into those alms-houses of my insignificant person. But the visit had its unforeseen consequences;and of a serious sort, too, in their way.\\nOne day when Mr. Creakle kept the house from indisposition, which naturally\\ndiffused a lively joy through the school, there was a good deal of noise in thecourse of the morning's work.

If I could associate the idea of abull or a bear with anyone so mild as Mr. Mell, I should think of him, in connexionwith that afternoon when the uproar was at its height, as of one of those animals,baited by a thousand dogs. I recall him bending his aching head, supported on hisbony hand, over the book on his desk, and wretchedly endeavouring to get on withhis tiresome work, amidst an uproar that might have made the Speaker of  theHouse of Commons giddy. Boys started in and out of their places, playing at pussin the corner with other boys; there were laughing boys, singing boys, talking boys,dancing boys, howling boys; boys shuffled with their feet, boys whirled about him,grinning, making faces, mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes;mimicking his poverty, his boots, his coat, his mother, everything belonging to himthat they should have had consideration for.\\n'Silence!' cried Mr. Mell, suddenly rising up, and striking his desk with the book.\\n'What does this mean! It's impossible to bear it. It's maddening. How can you do itto me, boys?'\\nIt was my book that he struck his desk with; and as I stood beside him, following\\nhis eye as it glanced round the room, I saw the boys all stop, some  suddenlysurprised, some half afraid, and some sorry perhaps.\\nSteerforth's place was at the bottom of the school, at the opposite end of the long\\nroom. He was lounging with his back against the wall, and his hands in his pockets,and looked at Mr. Mell with his mouth shut up as if he were whistling, when Mr.Mell looked at him.\\n'Silence, Mr. Steerforth!' said Mr. Mell.'Silence yourself,' said Steerforth, turning red. 'Whom are you talking to?''Sit down,' said Mr. Mell.'Sit down yourself,' said Steerforth, 'and mind your business.'There was a titter, and some applause; but Mr. Mell was so white, that silence\\nimmediately succeeded; and one boy, who had darted out behind him to imitate hismother again, changed his mind, and pretended to want a pen mended.\\n'If you think, Steerforth,' said Mr. Mell, 'that I am not acquainted with the power\\nyou can establish over any mind here'—he laid his hand, without considering whathe did (as I supposed), upon my head—'or that I have not observed you, within  afew minutes, urging your juniors on to every sort of outrage against me, you aremistaken.'\\n'I don't give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you,' said Steerforth, coolly;\\n'so I'm not mistaken, as it happens.'\\n'And when you make use of your position of favouritism here, sir,'  pursued  Mr.\"),\n",

You are always  abeggar, you know; but when you do that, you are an impudent beggar.'\\nI am not clear whether he was going to strike Mr. Mell, or Mr. Mell was going to\\nstrike him, or there was any such intention on either side. I saw  a  rigidity  comeupon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone, and found Mr. Creaklein the midst of us, with Tungay at his side, and Mrs. and Miss Creakle looking in atthe door as if they were frightened. Mr. Mell, with his elbows on his desk and hisface in his hands, sat, for some moments, quite still.\\n'Mr. Mell,' said Mr. Creakle, shaking him by the arm; and his whisper  was  so\\naudible now, that Tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words; 'you have  notforgotten yourself, I hope?'\\n'No, sir, no,' returned the Master, showing his face, and shaking his head,  and\\nrubbing his hands in great agitation. 'No, sir. No. I have remembered myself, I—no,Mr. Creakle, I have not forgotten myself, I—I have remembered myself, sir. I—I—could wish you had remembered me a little sooner, Mr. Creakle. It—it—wouldhave been more kind, sir, more just, sir. It would have saved me something, sir.'\\nMr. Creakle, looking hard at Mr. Mell, put his hand on Tungay's  shoulder, and got\\nhis feet upon the form close by, and sat upon the desk. After still looking hard atMr. Mell from his throne, as he shook his head, and rubbed his hands,  andremained in the same state of agitation, Mr. Creakle turned to Steerforth, and said:\\n'Now, sir, as he don't condescend to tell me, what is this?'Steerforth evaded the question for a little while; looking in scorn and anger on his\\nopponent, and remaining silent. I could not help thinking even in  that  interval,  Iremember, what a noble fellow he was in appearance, and how homely  and plainMr. Mell looked opposed to him.\\n'What did he mean by talking about favourites, then?' said Steerforth at length.'Favourites?' repeated Mr. Creakle, with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly.\\n'Who talked about favourites?'\\n'He did,' said Steerforth.'And pray, what did you mean by that, sir?' demanded Mr. Creakle, turning angrily\\non his assistant.\\n'I meant, Mr. Creakle,' he returned in a low voice, 'as I said; that no pupil had a\\nright to avail himself of his position of favouritism to degrade me.'\"),\n",

Steerforth approved of him highly, and told us he was aBrick.

These orders I obeyed, in such a flutter and hurry ofmy young spirits as I had never known before; and when I got to the parlour door,and the thought came into my head that it might be my mother—I had only thoughtof Mr. or Miss Murdstone until then—I drew back my hand from  the  lock,  andstopped to have a sob before I went in.\\nAt first I saw nobody; but feeling a pressure against the door, I looked round it, and\\nthere, to my amazement, were Mr. Peggotty and Ham, ducking at me  with  theirhats, and squeezing one another against the wall. I could not help laughing; but itwas much more in the pleasure of seeing them, than at the appearance they made.We shook hands in a very cordial way; and I laughed and laughed, until I pulledout my pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes.\\nMr. Peggotty (who never shut his mouth once, I remember, during the visit) showed\\ngreat concern when he saw me do this, and nudged Ham to say something.\\n'Cheer up, Mas'r Davy bor'!' said Ham, in his simpering way.

I walked along the\\npath towards the house, glancing at the windows, and fearing at every step to seeMr. Murdstone or Miss Murdstone lowering out of one of them. No face appeared,however; and being come to the house, and knowing how to open the door, beforedark, without knocking, I went in with a quiet, timid step.\\nGod knows how infantine the memory may have been, that was awakened within\\nme by the sound of my mother\\'s voice in the old parlour, when I set foot in the hall.She was singing in a low tone. I think I must have lain in her arms, and heard hersinging so to me when I was but a baby. The strain was new to me, and yet it wasso old that it filled my heart brim-full; like a friend come back from a longabsence.\\nI believed, from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother murmured her\\nsong, that she was alone. And I went softly into the room. She was  sitting by thefire, suckling an infant, whose tiny hand she held against her neck. Her eyes werelooking down upon its face, and she sat singing to it. I was so far right, that she hadno other companion.\\nI spoke to her, and she started, and cried out. But seeing me, she called me her dear'),\n",

Thisshe was doing when Peggotty came running in, and bounced down on the  groundbeside us, and went mad about us both for a quarter of an hour.\\nIt seemed that I had not been expected so soon, the carrier being much before his\\nusual time. It seemed, too, that Mr. and Miss Murdstone had gone out upon a visitin the neighbourhood, and would not return before night. I had never  hoped  forthis. I had never thought it possible that we three could be together undisturbed,once more; and I felt, for the time, as if the old days were come back.\\nWe dined together by the fireside. Peggotty was in attendance to wait upon us, but\\nmy mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us. I had my own oldplate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail upon it, which Peggotty hadhoarded somewhere all the time I had been away, and would not have had broken,she said, for a hundred pounds. I had my own old mug with David on it,  and myown old little knife and fork that wouldn't cut.\\nWhile we were at table, I thought it a favourable occasion to tell Peggotty about\\nMr. Barkis, who, before I had finished what I had to tell her, began to laugh, andthrow her apron over her face.\\n'Peggotty,' said my mother. 'What's the matter?'Peggotty only laughed the more, and held her apron tight over her face when my\\nmother tried to pull it away, and sat as if her head were in a bag.\\n'What are you doing, you stupid creature?' said my mother, laughing.'Oh, drat the man!' cried Peggotty. 'He wants to marry me.''It would be a very good match for you; wouldn't it?' said my mother.'Oh! I don't know,' said Peggotty. 'Don't ask me. I wouldn't have him if  he  was\\nmade of gold. Nor I wouldn't have anybody.'\\n'Then, why don't you tell him so, you ridiculous thing?' said my mother.'Tell him so,' retorted Peggotty, looking out of her apron. 'He has never said a word\\nto me about it. He knows better.

I thought of my father's grave in the churchyard,by our house, and of my mother lying there beneath the tree I knew so well. I stoodupon a chair when I was left alone, and looked into the glass to see how red myeyes were, and how sorrowful my face. I considered, after some hours were gone,if my tears were really hard to flow now, as they seemed to be, what, in connexionwith my loss, it would affect me most to think of when I drew near home—for Iwas going home to the funeral.

When school was over, and they came out  andspoke to me, I felt it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them, and totake exactly the same notice of them all, as before.\\nI was to go home next night; not by the mail, but by the heavy night-coach, which\\nwas called the Farmer, and was principally used by country-people travelling shortintermediate distances upon the road. We had no story-telling that evening, andTraddles insisted on lending me his pillow. I don't know what good he thought itwould do me, for I had one of my own: but it was all he had to lend, poor fellow,except a sheet of letter-paper full of skeletons; and that he gave me at parting, as asoother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind.\\nI left Salem House upon the morrow afternoon.

'I have tried, my dear, all ways I could think of—all the ways there\\nare, and all the ways there ain't, in short—to get a suitable service here, inBlunderstone; but there's no such a thing, my love.'\\n'And what do you mean to do, Peggotty,' says I, wistfully. 'Do you mean to go and\\nseek your fortune?'\\n'I expect I shall be forced to go to Yarmouth,' replied Peggotty, 'and live there.''You might have gone farther off,' I said, brightening a little, 'and been as bad as\\nlost. I shall see you sometimes, my dear old Peggotty, there. You won't be quite atthe other end of the world, will you?'\\n'Contrary ways, please God!' cried Peggotty, with great animation. 'As long as you\\nare here, my pet, I shall come over every week of my life to see you. One day,every week of my life!'\\nI felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise: but even this was not all,\\nfor Peggotty went on to say:\\n'I'm a-going, Davy, you see, to my brother's, first, for another fortnight's visit—just\\ntill I have had time to look about me, and get to be something like  myself again.Now, I have been thinking that perhaps, as they don't want you here at present, youmight be let to go along with me.'\\nIf anything, short of being in a different relation to every one about me, Peggotty\\nexcepted, could have given me a sense of pleasure at that time, it would have beenthis project of all others. The idea of being again surrounded by those honest faces,shining welcome on me; of renewing the peacefulness of the sweet Sundaymorning, when the bells were ringing, the stones dropping in the water,  and  theshadowy ships breaking through the mist; of roaming up and down with littleEm'ly, telling her my troubles, and finding charms against them in the shells andpebbles on the beach; made a calm in my heart. It was ruffled next moment, to besure, by a doubt of Miss Murdstone's giving her consent; but even that  was set atrest soon, for she came out to take an evening grope in the store-closet while wewere yet in conversation, and Peggotty, with a boldness that amazed me, broachedthe topic on the spot.\\n'The boy will be idle there,' said Miss Murdstone, looking into a  pickle -jar, 'and\\nidleness is the root of all evil. But, to be sure, he would be idle here—or anywhere,in my opinion.'\\nPeggotty had an angry answer ready, I could see; but she swallowed it for my sake,\\nand remained silent.\\n'Humph!' said Miss Murdstone, still keeping her eye on the pickles; 'it is of more\\nimportance than anything else—it is of paramount importance—that my brother\"),\n",

I suppose I had better say yes.'\\nI thanked her, without making any demonstration of joy, lest it should induce her to\\nwithdraw her assent. Nor could I help thinking this a prudent course, since shelooked at me out of the pickle-jar, with as great an access of sourness  as  if  herblack eyes had absorbed its contents. However, the permission was given, and wasnever retracted; for when the month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart.\\nMr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty's boxes. I had never  known  him  to\\npass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came into the house. And hegave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out, which I thought hadmeaning in it, if meaning could ever be said to find its way into  Mr.  Barkis'svisage.\\nPeggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many\\nyears, and where the two strong attachments of her life—for my mother and myself—had been formed. She had been walking in the churchyard, too, very early; andshe got into the cart, and sat in it with her handkerchief at her eyes.\\nSo long as she remained in this condition, Mr. Barkis gave no sign of life whatever.\\nHe sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure. But when shebegan to look about her, and to speak to me, he nodded his head and grinnedseveral times. I have not the least notion at whom, or what he meant by it.\\n'It's a beautiful day, Mr. Barkis!' I said, as an act of politeness.'It ain't bad,' said Mr. Barkis, who generally qualified his speech, and rarely\\ncommitted himself.\\n'Peggotty is quite comfortable now, Mr. Barkis,' I remarked, for his satisfaction.'Is she, though?' said Mr. Barkis.After reflecting about it, with a sagacious air, Mr. Barkis eyed her, and said:'ARE you pretty comfortable?'Peggotty laughed, and answered in the affirmative.'But really and truly, you know. Are you?' growled Mr. Barkis, sliding nearer to her\\non the seat, and nudging her with his elbow. 'Are you? Really and truly prettycomfortable? Are you? Eh?'\\nAt each of these inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer to her, and gave her another\\nnudge; so that at last we were all crowded together in the left-hand corner of thecart, and I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it.\\nPeggotty calling his attention to my sufferings, Mr. Barkis gave me a little more\\nroom at once, and got away by degrees. But I could not help observing  that  heseemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in aneat, agreeable, and pointed manner, without the inconvenience of inventingconversation. He manifestly chuckled over it for some time. By and by he turned toPeggotty again, and repeating, 'Are you pretty comfortable though?' bore  downupon us as before, until the breath was nearly edged out of my body. By and by hemade another descent upon us with the same inquiry, and the same result. Atlength, I got up whenever I saw him coming, and standing on the foot -board,pretended to look at the prospect; after which I did very well.\\nHe was so polite as to stop at a public-house, expressly on our account, and\"),\n",

Even when Peggotty was in the act of\\ndrinking, he was seized with one of those approaches, and almost choked her.

They received me and\\nPeggotty in an affectionate manner, and shook hands with Mr. Barkis, who, withhis hat on the very back of his head, and a shame-faced leer upon his countenance,and pervading his very legs, presented but a vacant appearance, I thought.  Theyeach took one of Peggotty's trunks, and we were going away, when Mr.  Barkissolemnly made a sign to me with his forefinger to come under an archway.\\n'I say,' growled Mr. Barkis, 'it was all right.'I looked up into his face, and answered, with an attempt to be very profound: 'Oh!''It didn't come to a end there,' said Mr. Barkis, nodding confidentially. 'It was all\\nright.'\\nAgain I answered, 'Oh!''You know who was willin',' said my friend. 'It was Barkis, and Barkis only.'I nodded assent.'It's all right,' said Mr. Barkis, shaking hands; 'I'm a friend of your'n. You made it\\nall right, first. It's all right.'\\nIn his attempts to be particularly lucid, Mr. Barkis was so extremely mysterious,\\nthat I might have stood looking in his face for an hour, and most assuredly shouldhave got as much information out of it as out of the face of a  clock  that  hadstopped, but for Peggotty's calling me away. As we were going along, she asked mewhat he had said; and I told her he had said it was all right.\\n'Like his impudence,' said Peggotty, 'but I don't mind that! Davy dear, what should\\nyou think if I was to think of being married?'\\n'Why—I suppose you would like me as much then, Peggotty, as you do now ?' I\\nreturned, after a little consideration.\\nGreatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street, as well as of her\\nrelations going on before, the good soul was obliged to stop and embrace me on thespot, with many protestations of her unalterable love.\\n'Tell me what should you say, darling?' she asked again, when this was over, and\\nwe were walking on.\\n'If you were thinking of being married—to Mr. Barkis, Peggotty?''Yes,' said Peggotty.'I should think it would be a very good thing. For then you know, Peggotty, you\\nwould always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me, and could comefor nothing, and be sure of coming.'\\n'The sense of the dear!' cried Peggotty.

As indeed I did, with all my heart.\\n'Well, my life,' said Peggotty, giving me a squeeze, 'I have thought of it night and\\nday, every way I can, and I hope the right way; but I'll think of it again, and speakto my brother about it, and in the meantime we'll keep it to ourselves, Davy, youand me.

This quotation from Mr. Barkis was so appropriate, andtickled us both so much, that we laughed again and again, and were quite in  apleasant humour when we came within view of Mr. Peggotty's cottage.\\nIt looked just the same, except that it may, perhaps, have shrunk a little in my eyes;\\nand Mrs. Gummidge was waiting at the door as if she had stood there ever since.All within was the same, down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom. Iwent into the out-house to look about me; and the very same lobsters, crabs, andcrawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general, appeared to bein the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner.\\nBut there was no little Em'ly to be seen, so I asked Mr. Peggotty where she was.'She's at school, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty, wiping the heat consequent on the porterage\\nof Peggotty's box from his forehead; 'she'll be home,' looking at the Dutch clock, 'infrom twenty minutes to half-an-hour's time.

Mr. Peggotty, looking round upon us while she was so engaged, said in a lowvoice, which he shaded with his hand: 'The old 'un!' From this I rightly conjecturedthat no improvement had taken place since my last visit in the state of Mrs.Gummidge's spirits.\\nNow, the whole place was, or it should have been, quite as delightful a place as\\never; and yet it did not impress me in the same way. I felt rather disappointed withit. Perhaps it was because little Em'ly was not at home. I knew the way by whichshe would come, and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her.\\nA figure appeared in the distance before long, and I soon knew it to be Em'ly, who\\nwas a little creature still in stature, though she was grown.

This obliged me to run after her, and sheran so fast that we were very near the cottage before I caught her.\\n'Oh, it's you, is it?' said little Em'ly.'Why, you knew who it was, Em'ly,' said I.'And didn't YOU know who it was?' said Em'ly. I was going to kiss her, but she\\ncovered her cherry lips with her hands, and said she wasn't a baby now, and ranaway, laughing more than ever, into the house.\\nShe seemed to delight in teasing me, which was a change in her I wondered at very\\nmuch. The tea table was ready, and our little locker was put out in its old place, butinstead of coming to sit by me, she went and bestowed her company upon thatgrumbling Mrs. Gummidge: and on Mr. Peggotty's inquiring why, rumpled her hairall over her face to hide it, and could do nothing but laugh.\\n'A little puss, it is!' said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with his great hand.'So sh' is! so sh' is!' cried Ham. 'Mas'r Davy bor', so sh' is!' and he sat and chuckled\\nat her for some time, in a state of mingled admiration and delight, that made hisface a burning red.\\nLittle Em'ly was spoiled by them all, in fact; and by no one more than Mr. Peggotty\\nhimself, whom she could have coaxed into anything, by only going and laying hercheek against his rough whisker. That was my opinion, at least, when I saw her doit; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be thoroughly in the right. But she was  soaffectionate and sweet-natured, and had such a pleasant manner of being both slyand shy at once, that she captivated me more than ever.\\nShe was tender-hearted, too; for when, as we sat round the fire after tea, an allusion\\nwas made by Mr. Peggotty over his pipe to the loss I had sustained, the tears stoodin her eyes, and she looked at me so kindly across the table, that I felt  quitethankful to her.\\n'Ah!' said Mr. Peggotty, taking up her curls, and running them over his hand like\\nwater, 'here's another orphan, you see, sir.

He is astonishingly clever.''There's a friend!' murmured Mr. Peggotty, with a grave toss of his head.'Nothing seems to cost him any trouble,' said I. 'He knows a task if he only looks at\\nit. He is the best cricketer you ever saw. He will give you almost  as many men asyou like at draughts, and beat you easily.'\\nMr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: 'Of course he will.''He is such a speaker,' I pursued, 'that he can win anybody over; and I don't know\\nwhat you'd say if you were to hear him sing, Mr. Peggotty.'\\nMr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, as much as to say: 'I have no doubt of it.''Then, he's such a generous, fine, noble fellow,' said I, quite carried away by my\\nfavourite theme, 'that it's hardly possible to give him as much praise as he deserves.I am sure I can never feel thankful enough for the generosity with which he hasprotected me, so much younger and lower in the school than himself.'\\nI was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em'ly's face,\\nwhich was bent forward over the table, listening with the deepest attention, herbreath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels, and the colour mantling in hercheeks.

She hadtasks to learn, and needle-work to do; and was absent during a great part of eachday. But I felt that we should not have had those old wanderings, even if it hadbeen otherwise. Wild and full of childish whims as Em'ly was, she was more of alittle woman than I had supposed. She seemed to have got a great distance awayfrom me, in little more than a year. She liked me, but she laughed at me, andtormented me; and when I went to meet her, stole home another way, and  waslaughing at the door when I came back, disappointed. The best times were whenshe sat quietly at work in the doorway, and I sat on the wooden step at her feet,reading to her. It seems to me, at this hour, that I have never seen such sunlight ason those bright April afternoons; that I have never seen such a sunny little figure asI used to see, sitting in the doorway of the old boat; that I have never beheld suchsky, such water, such glorified ships sailing away into golden air.\\nOn the very first evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared in an exceedingly\\nvacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle of oranges tied up in ahandkerchief. As he made no allusion of any kind to this property, he wassupposed to have left it behind him by accident when he went away; until Ham,running after him to restore it, came back with the information that it was intendedfor Peggotty. After that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the  samehour, and always with a little bundle, to which he never alluded, and  which  heregularly put behind the door and left there. These offerings of affection were of amost various and eccentric description. Among them I remember a double set ofpigs' trotters, a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of apples, a pair of jetearrings, some Spanish onions, a box of dominoes, a canary bird and cage, and aleg of pickled pork.\\nMr. Barkis's wooing, as I remember it, was altogether of a peculiar kind. He very\\nseldom said anything; but would sit by the fire in much the same attitude as he satin his cart, and stare heavily at Peggotty, who was opposite. One night, being, as Isuppose, inspired by love, he made a dart at the bit of wax-candle she kept for herthread, and put it in his waistcoat-pocket and carried it off. After that,  his  greatdelight was to produce it when it was wanted, sticking to the lining of his pocket, ina partially melted state, and pocket it again when it was done with. He seemed toenjoy himself very much, and not to feel at all called upon to  talk.  Even when hetook Peggotty out for a walk on the flats, he had no uneasiness on that  head,  Ibelieve; contenting himself with now and then asking her if she was prettycomfortable; and I remember that sometimes, after he was gone, Peggotty wouldthrow her apron over her face, and laugh for half-an-hour. Indeed, we were  allmore or less amused, except that miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose courtshipwould appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature, she was  so  continuallyreminded by these transactions of the old one.\\nAt length, when the term of my visit was nearly expired, it was given out that\\nPeggotty and Mr. Barkis were going to make a day's holiday together, and  thatlittle Em'ly and I were to accompany them. I had but a broken sleep the nightbefore, in anticipation of the pleasure of a whole day with Em'ly. We were all astirbetimes in the morning; and while we were yet at breakfast, Mr. Barkis appeared inthe distance, driving a chaise-cart towards the object of his affections.\\nPeggotty was dressed as usual, in her neat and quiet mourning; but Mr. Barkis\"),\n",

Rendered complete by drab pantaloonsand a buff waistcoat, I thought Mr. Barkis a phenomenon of respectability.\\nWhen we were all in a bustle outside the door, I found that Mr. Peggotty was\\nprepared with an old shoe, which was to be thrown after us for luck, and which heoffered to Mrs. Gummidge for that purpose.\\n'No. It had better be done by somebody else, Dan'l,' said Mrs. Gummidge.

You don't feel like me, Dan'l; thinks don't go contrary  withyou, nor you with them; you had better do it yourself.'\\nBut here Peggotty, who had been going about from one to another in  a  hurried\\nway, kissing everybody, called out from the cart, in which we all were by this time(Em'ly and I on two little chairs, side by side), that Mrs. Gummidge must do it. SoMrs. Gummidge did it; and, I am sorry to relate, cast a damp upon the festivecharacter of our departure, by immediately bursting into tears, and sinking subduedinto the arms of Ham, with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden, andhad better be carried to the House at once. Which I really thought was a sensibleidea, that Ham might have acted on.\\nAway we went, however, on our holiday excursion; and the first thing we did was\\nto stop at a church, where Mr. Barkis tied the horse to some rails, and went in withPeggotty, leaving little Em'ly and me alone in the chaise. I took that occasion to putmy arm round Em'ly's waist, and propose that as I was going away so very soonnow, we should determine to be very affectionate to one another, and very happy,all day. Little Em'ly consenting, and allowing me to kiss her, I became desperate;informing her, I recollect, that I never could love another, and that  I was preparedto shed the blood of anybody who should aspire to her affections.\\nHow merry little Em'ly made herself about it!

If so, it sharpened his appetite; for I distinctly callto mind that, although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at dinner, andhad finished off with a fowl or two, he was obliged to have cold boiled bacon fortea, and disposed of a large quantity without any emotion.\\nI have often thought, since, what an odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind of wedding\\nit must have been! We got into the chaise again soon after dark, and drove cosilyback, looking up at the stars, and talking about them. I was their chief exponent,and opened Mr. Barkis's mind to an amazing extent. I told him all  I knew, but hewould have believed anything I might have taken it into my head to impart to him;for he had a profound veneration for my abilities, and informed his wife  in  myhearing, on that very occasion, that I was 'a young Roeshus'—by  which I think hemeant prodigy.\\nWhen we had exhausted the subject of the stars, or rather when I had exhausted the\\nmental faculties of Mr. Barkis, little Em'ly and I made a cloak of an old wrapper,and sat under it for the rest of the journey. Ah, how I loved her! What happiness (Ithought) if we were married, and were going away anywhere to live  among  thetrees and in the fields, never growing older, never growing wiser,  children  ever,rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows, layingdown our heads on moss at night, in a sweet sleep of purity and peace, and buriedby the birds when we were dead! Some such picture, with no real world in it, brightwith the light of our innocence, and vague as the stars afar off, was in my mind allthe way.

After breakfast shetook me to her own home, and a beautiful little home it was. Of all the moveablesin it, I must have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in theparlour (the tile-floored kitchen was the general sitting-room), with a retreating topwhich opened, let down, and became a desk, within which was a large  quartoedition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. This precious volume, of which I do notrecollect one word, I immediately discovered and immediately applied myself to;and I never visited the house afterwards, but I kneeled on a chair, opened the casketwhere this gem was enshrined, spread my arms over the desk, and fell to devouringthe book afresh. I was chiefly edified, I am afraid, by the pictures, which  werenumerous, and represented all kinds of dismal horrors; but the Martyrs andPeggotty's house have been inseparable in my mind ever since, and are now.\\nI took leave of Mr. Peggotty, and Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge, and little Em'ly, that\\nday; and passed the night at Peggotty's, in a little room in the roof (with theCrocodile Book on a shelf by the bed's head) which was to be always mine,Peggotty said, and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state.\\n'Young or old, Davy dear, as long as I am alive and have this house over my head,'\\nsaid Peggotty, 'you shall find it as if I expected you here directly minute. I shallkeep it every day, as I used to keep your old little room, my darling; and if you wasto go to China, you might think of it as being kept just the same, all  the time youwere away.'\\nI felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse, with all my heart, and thanked\\nher as well as I could. That was not very well, for she spoke to me thus, with herarms round my neck, in the morning, and I was going home in the morning, and Iwent home in the morning, with herself and Mr. Barkis in the cart. They left me atthe gate, not easily or lightly; and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on,taking Peggotty away, and leaving me under the old elm-trees looking at the house,in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking any more.\\nAnd now I fell into a state of neglect, which I cannot look back upon without\\ncompassion. I fell at once into a solitary condition,—apart from all friendly notice,apart from the society of all other boys of my own age, apart from allcompanionship but my own spiritless thoughts,—which seems to cast its gloomupon this paper as I write.\\nWhat would I have given, to have been sent to the hardest school  that  ever  was\\nkept!—to have been taught something, anyhow, anywhere! No such hope dawnedupon me. They disliked me; and they sullenly, sternly, steadily, overlooked me. Ithink Mr. Murdstone's means were straitened at about this time; but it is little to thepurpose. He could not bear me; and in putting me from him he tried, as I believe,to put away the notion that I had any claim upon him—and succeeded.\\nI was not actively ill-used. I was not beaten, or starved; but the  wrong  that  was\\ndone to me had no intervals of relenting, and was done in a systematic, passionlessmanner. Day after day, week after week, month after month, I was coldlyneglected. I wonder sometimes, when I think of it, what they would have done if Ihad been taken with an illness; whether I should have lain down in my lonelyroom, and languished through it in my usual solitary way, or whether anybodywould have helped me out.\"),\n",

At all times I lounged about the  house  andneighbourhood quite disregarded, except that they were jealous of my making  anyfriends: thinking, perhaps, that if I did, I might complain to someone.  For  thisreason, though Mr. Chillip often asked me to go and see him (he was a widower,having, some years before that, lost a little small light-haired wife, whom I can justremember connecting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoise-shell cat), it was butseldom that I enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet  of  asurgery; reading some book that was new to me, with the smell of the wholePharmacopoeia coming up my nose, or pounding something in a mortar under hismild directions.\\nFor the same reason, added no doubt to the old dislike of her, I was seldom allowed\\nto visit Peggotty. Faithful to her promise, she either came to see me,  or  met  mesomewhere near, once every week, and never empty-handed; but many and bitterwere the disappointments I had, in being refused permission to pay a visit to her ather house. Some few times, however, at long intervals, I was allowed to go there;and then I found out that Mr. Barkis was something of a miser, or as  Peggottydutifully expressed it, was 'a little near', and kept a heap of money in a box underhis bed, which he pretended was only full of coats and trousers. In this coffer, hisriches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty, that the smallest instalmentscould only be tempted out by artifice; so that Peggotty had to prepare a long andelaborate scheme, a very Gunpowder Plot, for every Saturday's expenses.\\nAll this time I was so conscious of the waste of any promise I had given, and of\\nmy being utterly neglected, that I should have been perfectly miserable, I have nodoubt, but for the old books.

'You are Brooks of Sheffield.\\nThat's your name.'\\nAt these words, I observed the gentleman more attentively. His laugh coming to my\\nremembrance too, I knew him to be Mr. Quinion, whom I had gone over toLowestoft with Mr. Murdstone to see, before—it is no matter—I need  not  recallwhen.\\n'And how do you get on, and where are you being educated, Brooks?' said  Mr.\\nQuinion.\\nHe had put his hand upon my shoulder, and turned me about, to walk with them.

But none was made; and I became, at ten years old, a little labouring hind\\nin the service of Murdstone and Grinby.\\nMurdstone and Grinby's warehouse was at the waterside. It was down in\\nBlackfriars. Modern improvements have altered the place; but it was the last houseat the bottom of a narrow street, curving down hill to the river, with some stairs atthe end, where people took boat. It was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own,abutting on the water when the tide was in, and on the mud when the tide was out,and literally overrun with rats. Its panelled rooms, discoloured with the dirt  andsmoke of a hundred years, I dare say; its decaying floors and staircase; thesqueaking and scuffling of the old grey rats down in the cellars; and the dirt androttenness of the place; are things, not of many years ago, in my mind, but of thepresent instant. They are all before me, just as they were in the evil hour when Iwent among them for the first time, with my trembling hand in Mr. Quinion's.\\nMurdstone and Grinby's trade was among a good many kinds of people, but  an\\nimportant branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to certain packet ships. Iforget now where they chiefly went, but I think there were some among them thatmade voyages both to the East and West Indies. I know that a great many emptybottles were one of the consequences of this traffic, and that certain men and boyswere employed to examine them against the light, and reject those that  wereflawed, and to rinse and wash them. When the empty bottles ran short, there werelabels to be pasted on full ones, or corks to be fitted to them, or seals to be putupon the corks, or finished bottles to be packed in casks. All this  work  was  mywork, and of the boys employed upon it I was one.\\nThere were three or four of us, counting me. My working place was established in\\na corner of the warehouse, where Mr. Quinion could see me, when he  chose  tostand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the counting-house, and look at methrough a window above the desk. Hither, on the first morning of my soauspiciously beginning life on my own account, the oldest of the regular boys wassummoned to show me my business. His name was Mick Walker, and he wore aragged apron and a paper cap. He informed me that his father was a bargeman, andwalked, in a black velvet head-dress, in the Lord Mayor's Show. He also informedme that our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by the—to me—extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however, that  thisyouth had not been christened by that name, but that it had been bestowed uponhim in the warehouse, on account of his complexion, which was pale or  mealy.Mealy's father was a waterman, who had the additional distinction of being afireman, and was engaged as such at one of the large theatres; where some youngrelation of Mealy's—I think his little sister—did Imps in the Pantomimes.\\nNo words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this\\ncompanionship; compared these henceforth everyday associates with those of myhappier childhood—not to say with Steerforth, Traddles, and the rest of those boys;and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man, crushed inmy bosom. The deep remembrance of the sense I had, of being utterly withouthope now; of the shame I felt in my position; of the misery it was to my youngheart to believe that day by day what I had learned, and thought, and delighted in,and raised my fancy and my emulation up by, would pass away from me, little bylittle, never to be brought back any more; cannot be written. As often as MickWalker went away in the course of that forenoon, I mingled my tears with thewater in which I was washing the bottles; and sobbed as if there were a flaw in myown breast, and it were in danger of bursting.\"),\n",

She said she had tried to exert herself, and so, I  have  no\\ndoubt, she had. The centre of the street door was perfectly covered  with  a  greatbrass-plate, on which was engraved 'Mrs. Micawber's Boarding Establishment forYoung Ladies': but I never found that any young lady had ever been to schoolthere; or that any young lady ever came, or proposed to come; or that  the  leastpreparation was ever made to receive any young lady. The only visitors I ever saw,or heard of, were creditors. THEY used to come at all hours, and some of themwere quite ferocious. One dirty-faced man, I think he was a boot-maker, used toedge himself into the passage as early as seven o'clock in the morning, and call upthe stairs to Mr. Micawber—'Come! You ain't out yet, you know. Pay us, will you?Don't hide, you know; that's mean. I wouldn't be mean if I was you. Pay us,  willyou? You just pay us, d'ye hear? Come!' Receiving no answer to these taunts, hewould mount in his wrath to the words 'swindlers' and 'robbers'; and these beingineffectual too, would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street,  androaring up at the windows of the second floor, where he knew Mr. Micawber was.At these times, Mr. Micawber would be transported with grief and mortification,even to the length (as I was once made aware by a scream from his  wife)  ofmaking motions at himself with a razor; but within half-an-hour afterwards, hewould polish up his shoes with extraordinary pains, and go out, humming a tunewith a greater air of gentility than ever. Mrs. Micawber was quite as elastic. I haveknown her to be thrown into fainting fits by the king's taxes at three o'clock, and toeat lamb chops, breaded, and drink warm ale (paid for with two tea-spoons that hadgone to the pawnbroker's) at four. On one occasion, when an execution had justbeen put in, coming home through some chance as early as six o'clock, I saw herlying (of course with a twin) under the grate in a swoon, with her hair all torn abouther face; but I never knew her more cheerful than she was, that very same night,over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire, telling me stories about her papa  andmama, and the company they used to keep.\\nIn this house, and with this family, I passed my leisure time. My own exclusive\\nbreakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk, I provided myself. I keptanother small loaf, and a modicum of cheese, on a particular shelf of a particularcupboard, to make my supper on when I came back at night. This made a hole inthe six or seven shillings, I know well; and I was out at the warehouse all day, andhad to support myself on that money all the week. From Monday  morning  untilSaturday night, I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, noassistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hopeto go to heaven!\\nI was so young and childish, and so little qualified—how could I be otherwise?—\\nto undertake the whole charge of my own existence, that often, in going toMurdstone and Grinby's, of a morning, I could not resist the stale pastry put out forsale at half-price at the pastrycooks' doors, and spent in that the money I shouldhave kept for my dinner. Then, I went without my dinner, or bought  a  roll  or  aslice of pudding. I remember two pudding shops, between which I was  divided,according to my finances.

The pudding at that  shop\\nwas made of currants, and was rather a special pudding, but was dear,\\ntwopennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding. Agood shop for the latter was in the Strand—somewhere in that part which has beenrebuilt since. It was a stout pale pudding, heavy and flabby, and with great  flatraisins in it, stuck in whole at wide distances apart. It came up hot at about my timeevery day, and many a day did I dine off it. When I dined regularly  andhandsomely, I had a saveloy and a penny loaf, or a fourpenny plate of red beeffrom a cook's shop; or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of  beer,  from  amiserable old public-house opposite our place of business, called the Lion, or theLion and something else that I have forgotten. Once, I remember carrying my ownbread (which I had brought from home in the morning) under my arm, wrapped ina piece of paper, like a book, and going to a famous alamode beef-house nearDrury Lane, and ordering a 'small plate' of that delicacy to eat with it. What thewaiter thought of such a strange little apparition coming in all alone, I don't know;but I can see him now, staring at me as I ate my dinner, and bringing up the otherwaiter to look. I gave him a halfpenny for himself, and I wish he hadn't taken it.\\nWe had half-an-hour, I think, for tea. When I had money enough, I used to get\\nhalf-a-pint of ready-made coffee and a slice of bread and butter. When I had none,I used to look at a venison shop in Fleet Street; or I have strolled, at such a time, asfar as Covent Garden Market, and stared at the pineapples. I was fond ofwandering about the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those darkarches. I see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches, on a littlepublic-house close to the river, with an open space before it, where some  coal -heavers were dancing; to look at whom I sat down upon a bench. I wonder whatthey thought of me!\\nI was such a child, and so little, that frequently when I went into the bar of a\\nstrange public-house for a glass of ale or porter, to moisten what I had  had  fordinner, they were afraid to give it me.

It may have beenmy birthday.\\n'Twopence-halfpenny,' says the landlord, 'is the price of the Genuine Stunning ale.''Then,' says I, producing the money, 'just draw me a glass of the Genuine Stunning,\\nif you please, with a good head to it.'\\nThe landlord looked at me in return over the bar, from head to foot, with a strange\\nsmile on his face; and instead of drawing the beer, looked round  the  screen  andsaid something to his wife. She came out from behind it, with her work in her hand,and joined him in surveying me. Here we stand, all three, before me now. Thelandlord in his shirt-sleeves, leaning against the bar window-frame; his wifelooking over the little half-door; and I, in some confusion, looking up at them fromoutside the partition. They asked me a good many questions; as, what  my  namewas, how old I was, where I lived, how I was employed, and how I came there. Toall of which, that I might commit nobody, I invented, I am afraid,  appropriateanswers. They served me with the ale, though I suspect it was not the  GenuineStunning; and the landlord's wife, opening the little half-door of the bar, andbending down, gave me my money back, and gave me a kiss that was half admiringand half compassionate, but all womanly and good, I am sure.\\nI know I do not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally, the  scantiness  of\\nmy resources or the difficulties of my life.

Besides that  Mr. Quinion\\ndid what a careless man so occupied, and dealing with a thing so  anomalous,could, to treat me as one upon a different footing from the rest, I never said, toman or boy, how it was that I came to be there, or gave the least indication of beingsorry that I was there. That I suffered in secret, and that  I suffered exquisitely, noone ever knew but I. How much I suffered, it is, as I have  said  already,  utterlybeyond my power to tell. But I kept my own counsel, and I did my work. I knewfrom the first, that, if I could not do my work as well as any of the rest, I could nothold myself above slight and contempt. I soon became at least as expeditious andas skilful as either of the other boys. Though perfectly familiar with them, myconduct and manner were different enough from theirs to place a space between us.They and the men generally spoke of me as 'the little gent', or 'the  youngSuffolker.' A certain man named Gregory, who was foreman of the packers, andanother named Tipp, who was the carman, and wore a red jacket, used to addressme sometimes as 'David': but I think it was mostly when we were very confidential,and when I had made some efforts to entertain them, over our work,  with  someresults of the old readings; which were fast perishing out of my remembrance.Mealy Potatoes uprose once, and rebelled against my being so distinguished; butMick Walker settled him in no time.\\nMy rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless, and abandoned,\\nas such, altogether. I am solemnly convinced that I never for one hour wasreconciled to it, or was otherwise than miserably unhappy; but I bore it; and evento Peggotty, partly for the love of her and partly for shame, never in any  letter(though many passed between us) revealed the truth.\\nMr. Micawber's difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of my mind. In\\nmy forlorn state I became quite attached to the family, and used to  walk  about,busy with Mrs. Micawber's calculations of ways and means, and heavy  with  theweight of Mr. Micawber's debts. On a Saturday night, which was my grand treat,—partly because it was a great thing to walk home with six or seven shillings in mypocket, looking into the shops and thinking what such a sum would buy, and partlybecause I went home early,—Mrs. Micawber would make the most heart-rendingconfidences to me; also on a Sunday morning, when I mixed  the portion of tea orcoffee I had bought over-night, in a little shaving-pot, and sat late at my breakfast.It was nothing at all unusual for Mr. Micawber to sob violently at the beginning ofone of these Saturday night conversations, and sing about jack's delight being hislovely Nan, towards the end of it. I have known him come home to supper with aflood of tears, and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail; and go to bedmaking a calculation of the expense of putting bow-windows to the house, 'in caseanything turned up', which was his favourite expression. And Mrs. Micawber wasjust the same.\\nA curious equality of friendship, originating, I suppose, in our respective\\ncircumstances, sprung up between me and these people, notwithstanding theludicrous disparity in our years. But I never allowed myself to be prevailed upon toaccept any invitation to eat and drink with them out of their stock (knowing thatthey got on badly with the butcher and baker, and had often not too much forthemselves), until Mrs. Micawber took me into her entire confidence.

He solemnly conjured me, I remember, to takewarning by his fate; and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds a-year for hisincome, and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would behappy, but that if he spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable.

I thought it was better to borrow  CaptainHopkins's knife and fork, than Captain Hopkins's comb. The Captain himself was inthe last extremity of shabbiness, with large whiskers, and an old, old brown great-coat with no other coat below it. I saw his bed rolled up in a  corner;  and  whatplates and dishes and pots he had, on a shelf; and I divined (God knows how) thatthough the two girls with the shock heads of hair were Captain Hopkins's children,the dirty lady was not married to Captain Hopkins.

With these possessions we\\nencamped, as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace;\\nMrs. Micawber, the children, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those roomsnight and day. I have no idea for how long, though it seems to me for a long time.At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber hadnow secured a room to himself. So I took the key of the house to the landlord, whowas very glad to get it; and the beds were sent over to the King's Bench, exceptmine, for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood ofthat Institution, very much to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I hadbecome too used to one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewiseaccommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine wasa quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant prospect of atimberyard; and when I took possession of it, with the reflection that Mr.Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I thought it quite a paradise.\\nAll this time I was working at Murdstone and Grinby's in the same common way,\\nand with the same common companions, and with the same sense of unmeriteddegradation as at first. But I never, happily for me no doubt, made a  singleacquaintance, or spoke to any of the many boys whom I saw daily in going to thewarehouse, in coming from it, and in prowling about the streets at meal-times. I ledthe same secretly unhappy life; but I led it in the same lonely, self-reliant manner.The only changes I am conscious of are, firstly, that I had grown more shabby, andsecondly, that I was now relieved of much of the weight of Mr. and  Mrs.Micawber's cares; for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them  at theirpresent pass, and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived fora long while out of it. I used to breakfast with them now, in virtue of somearrangement, of which I have forgotten the details. I forget, too, at what hour thegates were opened in the morning, admitting of my going in; but I know that I wasoften up at six o'clock, and that my favourite lounging-place in the interval was oldLondon Bridge, where I was wont to sit in one of the stone recesses, watching thepeople going by, or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water, andlighting up the golden flame on the top of the Monument. The Orfling met me heresometimes, to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and theTower; of which I can say no more than that I hope I believed them myself. In theevening I used to go back to the prison, and walk up and down the parade with Mr.Micawber; or play casino with Mrs. Micawber, and hear reminiscences of her papaand mama.

To everybody insuccession, Captain Hopkins said: 'Have you read it?'—'No.'—-'Would you like tohear it read?' If he weakly showed the least disposition to hear it, Captain Hopkins,in a loud sonorous voice, gave him every word of it. The Captain would have readit twenty thousand times, if twenty thousand people would have heard him, one byone.

When my thoughts go back, now, tothat slow agony of my youth, I wonder how much of the histories I invented forsuch people hangs like a mist of fancy over well-remembered facts!

Collar him!'\\n'My poor papa's maxim,' Mrs. Micawber observed.'My dear,' said Mr. Micawber, 'your papa was very well in his way, and Heaven\\nforbid that I should disparage him. Take him for all in all, we ne'er shall—in short,make the acquaintance, probably, of anybody else possessing, at his time of life,the same legs for gaiters, and able to read the same description of print, withoutspectacles. But he applied that maxim to our marriage, my dear; and that was so farprematurely entered into, in consequence, that I never recovered the expense.' Mr.Micawber looked aside at Mrs. Micawber, and added: 'Not that I am sorry for it.Quite the contrary, my love.' After which, he was grave for a minute or so.\\n'My other piece of advice, Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'you know. Annual\\nincome twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six, resulthappiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds oughtand six, result misery. The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered, the god of daygoes down upon the dreary scene, and—and in short you are for ever floored.

Nextmorning I met the whole family at the coach office, and saw them, with a desolateheart, take their places outside, at the back.\\n'Master Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'God bless you! I never can  forget  all\\nthat, you know, and I never would if I could.'\\n'Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'farewell! Every happiness and prosperity!

I think so, because she beckoned to me toclimb up, with quite a new and motherly expression in her face, and put her armround my neck, and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her ownboy. I had barely time to get down again before the coach started, and I couldhardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved. It was gone in a minute.The Orfling and I stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of the road,and then shook hands and said good-bye; she going back, I suppose, to St. Luke'sworkhouse, as I went to begin my weary day at Murdstone and Grinby's.\\nBut with no intention of passing many more weary days there. No. I had resolved\\nto run away.—-To go, by some means or other, down into the country, to the onlyrelation I had in the world, and tell my story to my aunt, Miss Betsey. I havealready observed that I don't know how this desperate idea came into  my  brain.But, once there, it remained there; and hardened into a purpose than which I havenever entertained a more determined purpose in my life. I am far from sure that  Ibelieved there was anything hopeful in it, but my mind was thoroughly made upthat it must be carried into execution.\\nAgain, and again, and a hundred times again, since the night when the thought had\\nfirst occurred to me and banished sleep, I had gone over that old story of my poormother's about my birth, which it had been one of my great delights in the old timeto hear her tell, and which I knew by heart. My aunt walked into that story, andwalked out of it, a dread and awful personage; but there was one little trait in herbehaviour which I liked to dwell on, and which gave me some faint shadow  ofencouragement. I could not forget how my mother had thought that she  felt  hertouch her pretty hair with no ungentle hand; and though it might have beenaltogether my mother's fancy, and might have had no foundation whatever in fact, Imade a little picture, out of it, of my terrible aunt relenting towards the girlishbeauty that I recollected so well and loved so much, which softened the wholenarrative. It is very possible that it had been in my mind a long time, and  hadgradually engendered my determination.\\nAs I did not even know where Miss Betsey lived, I wrote a long letter to Peggotty,\\nand asked her, incidentally, if she remembered; pretending that I had heard of sucha lady living at a certain place I named at random, and had a curiosity to know if itwere the same. In the course of that letter, I told Peggotty that I had a particularoccasion for half a guinea; and that if she could lend me that sum  until  I  couldrepay it, I should be very much obliged to her, and would tell her afterwards what Ihad wanted it for.\\nPeggotty's answer soon arrived, and was, as usual, full of affectionate devotion. She\\nenclosed the half guinea (I was afraid she must have had a world of trouble to get itout of Mr. Barkis's box), and told me that Miss Betsey lived near Dover, butwhether at Dover itself, at Hythe, Sandgate, or Folkestone, she could not say. Oneof our men, however, informing me on my asking him about these places, that theywere all close together, I deemed this enough for my object, and resolved to set outat the end of that week.\\nBeing a very honest little creature, and unwilling to disgrace the memory  I  was\\ngoing to leave behind me at Murdstone and Grinby's, I considered myself bound toremain until Saturday night; and, as I had been paid a week's  wages  in  advance\"),\n",

This I had in my pocket readyto put on the box, after I should have got it out of the house; and as I went towardsmy lodging, I looked about me for someone who would help me to carry it to thebooking-office.\\nThere was a long-legged young man with a very little empty donkey-cart, standing\\nnear the Obelisk, in the Blackfriars Road, whose eye I caught as I was going by,and who, addressing me as 'Sixpenn'orth of bad ha'pence,' hoped 'I should knowhim agin to swear to'—in allusion, I have no doubt, to my staring at him. I stoppedto assure him that I had not done so in bad manners, but uncertain whether  hemight or might not like a job.\\n'Wot job?' said the long-legged young man.'To move a box,' I answered.'Wot box?' said the long-legged young man.I told him mine, which was down that street there, and which I wanted him to take\\nto the Dover coach office for sixpence.\\n'Done with you for a tanner!' said the long-legged young man, and directly got\\nupon his cart, which was nothing but a large wooden tray on wheels, and rattledaway at such a rate, that it was as much as I could do to keep pace with the donkey.\\nThere was a defiant manner about this young man, and particularly about the way\\nin which he chewed straw as he spoke to me, that I did not much like; as thebargain was made, however, I took him upstairs to the room I was leaving, and webrought the box down, and put it on his cart. Now, I was unwilling to put thedirection-card on there, lest any of my landlord's family should fathom what I wasdoing, and detain me; so I said to the young man that I would be glad if he wouldstop for a minute, when he came to the dead-wall of the King's Bench prison. Thewords were no sooner out of my mouth, than he rattled away as if he, my box, thecart, and the donkey, were all equally mad; and I was quite out of breath withrunning and calling after him, when I caught him at the place appointed.\\nBeing much flushed and excited, I tumbled my half-guinea out of  my  pocket  in\\npulling the card out. I put it in my mouth for safety, and though my hands trembleda good deal, had just tied the card on very much to my  satisfaction,  when  I  feltmyself violently chucked under the chin by the long-legged young man, and sawmy half-guinea fly out of my mouth into his hand.\\n'Wot!' said the young man, seizing me by my jacket collar, with a frightful grin.\\n'This is a pollis case, is it?

At length, confusedby fright and heat, and doubting whether half London might not by this time beturning out for my apprehension, I left the young man to go where he would withmy box and money; and, panting and crying, but never stopping, faced about forGreenwich, which I had understood was on the Dover Road: taking very little moreout of the world, towards the retreat of my aunt, Miss Betsey, than I had broughtinto it, on the night when my arrival gave her so much umbrage.\\nCHAPTER 13. THE SEQUEL OF MY\\nRESOLUTION\\nFor anything I know, I may have had some wild idea of running all  the  way  toDover, when I gave up the pursuit of the young man with the  donkey -cart, andstarted for Greenwich. My scattered senses were soon collected as to that point, if Ihad; for I came to a stop in the Kent Road, at a terrace with a piece of water beforeit, and a great foolish image in the middle, blowing a dry shell. Here I sat down ona doorstep, quite spent and exhausted with the efforts I had already made, and withhardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and half-guinea.\\nIt was by this time dark; I heard the clocks strike ten, as I sat resting. But it was a\\nsummer night, fortunately, and fine weather. When I had recovered my breath, andhad got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat, I rose up and went on. In the midstof my distress, I had no notion of going back. I doubt if I should have had any,though there had been a Swiss snow-drift in the Kent Road.\\nBut my standing possessed of only three-halfpence in the world (and I am sure I\\nwonder how they came to be left in my pocket on a  Saturday night!) troubled menone the less because I went on. I began to picture to myself, as a scrap ofnewspaper intelligence, my being found dead in a day or two, under  some hedge;and I trudged on miserably, though as fast as I could, until I happened to pass alittle shop, where it was written up that ladies' and gentlemen's wardrobes  werebought, and that the best price was given for rags, bones, and kitchen-stuff. Themaster of this shop was sitting at the door in his shirt-sleeves, smoking;  and  asthere were a great many coats and pairs of trousers dangling from the low ceiling,\"),\n",

I went up the next by-street,took off my waistcoat, rolled it neatly under my arm, and came back to the shopdoor.\\n'If you please, sir,' I said, 'I am to sell this for a fair price.'Mr. Dolloby—Dolloby was the name over the shop door, at least—took the\\nwaistcoat, stood his pipe on its head, against the door-post, went into the  shop,followed by me, snuffed the two candles with his fingers, spread the waistcoat onthe counter, and looked at it there, held it up against the light, and looked at it there,and ultimately said:\\n'What do you call a price, now, for this here little weskit?''Oh! you know best, sir,' I returned modestly.'I can't be buyer and seller too,' said Mr. Dolloby. 'Put a price on this here little\\nweskit.'\\n'Would eighteenpence be?'—I hinted, after some hesitation.Mr. Dolloby rolled it up again, and gave it me back. 'I should rob my family,' he\\nsaid, 'if I was to offer ninepence for it.'\\nThis was a disagreeable way of putting the business; because it imposed upon me, a\\nperfect stranger, the unpleasantness of asking Mr. Dolloby to rob his family on myaccount. My circumstances being so very pressing, however, I said I would takeninepence for it, if he pleased. Mr. Dolloby, not without some grumbling, gaveninepence. I wished him good night, and walked out of the shop the richer by thatsum, and the poorer by a waistcoat. But when I buttoned my jacket, that  was notmuch. Indeed, I foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next, and that  Ishould have to make the best of my way to Dover in a shirt and a pair of trousers,and might deem myself lucky if I got there even in that trim. But my mind did notrun so much on this as might be supposed. Beyond a general impression  of  thedistance before me, and of the young man with the donkey-cart having used mecruelly, I think I had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when I once again setoff with my ninepence in my pocket.\\nA plan had occurred to me for passing the night, which I was going to carry into\\nexecution. This was, to lie behind the wall at the back of my old school, in a cornerwhere there used to be a haystack. I imagined it would be a kind of company tohave the boys, and the bedroom where I used to tell the stories, so near me:although the boys would know nothing of my being there, and the bedroom wouldyield me no shelter.\\nI had had a hard day's work, and was pretty well jaded when I came climbing out,\\nat last, upon the level of Blackheath. It cost me some trouble to find  out  SalemHouse; but I found it, and I found a haystack in the corner, and I lay down by it;having first walked round the wall, and looked up at the windows, and seen that allwas dark and silent within. Never shall I forget the lonely sensation of first lyingdown, without a roof above my head!\\nSleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts, against whom house-doors\"),\n",

When I remembered where I was at that untimely hour, afeeling stole upon me that made me get up, afraid of I don't know what, and walkabout. But the fainter glimmering of the stars, and the pale light in the sky wherethe day was coming, reassured me: and my eyes being very heavy, I lay downagain and slept—though with a knowledge in my sleep that  it was cold—until thewarm beams of the sun, and the ringing of the getting-up bell at Salem  House,awoke me. If I could have hoped that Steerforth was there, I  would have  lurkedabout until he came out alone; but I knew he must have left long since. Traddlesstill remained, perhaps, but it was very doubtful; and I had not sufficientconfidence in his discretion or good luck, however strong my reliance was on hisgood nature, to wish to trust him with my situation. So I crept away from the wallas Mr. Creakle's boys were getting up, and struck into the long dusty track which Ihad first known to be the Dover Road when I was one of them,  and when I littleexpected that any eyes would ever see me the wayfarer I was now, upon it.\\nWhat a different Sunday morning from the old Sunday morning at Yarmouth! In\\ndue time I heard the church-bells ringing, as I plodded on; and I met  people whowere going to church; and I passed a church or two where  the congregation wereinside, and the sound of singing came out into the sunshine, while the beadle satand cooled himself in the shade of the porch, or stood beneath the yew-tree, withhis hand to his forehead, glowering at me going by. But the peace and rest of theold Sunday morning were on everything, except me. That was the difference. I feltquite wicked in my dirt and dust, with my tangled hair. But for the quiet picture Ihad conjured up, of my mother in her youth and beauty, weeping by the  fire, andmy aunt relenting to her, I hardly think I should have had the courage to go on untilnext day. But it always went before me, and I followed.\\nI got, that Sunday, through three-and-twenty miles on the straight road, though not\\nvery easily, for I was new to that kind of toil. I see myself, as evening closes in,coming over the bridge at Rochester, footsore and tired, and eating bread that I hadbought for supper. One or two little houses, with the notice, 'Lodgings forTravellers', hanging out, had tempted me; but I was afraid of spending the fewpence I had, and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers I hadmet or overtaken. I sought no shelter, therefore, but the sky; and toiling intoChatham,—which, in that night's aspect, is a mere dream of chalk, anddrawbridges, and mastless ships in a muddy river, roofed like Noah's arks,—crept,at last, upon a sort of grass-grown battery overhanging a lane, where a sentry waswalking to and fro. Here I lay down, near a cannon; and, happy in the society ofthe sentry's footsteps, though he knew no more of my being above him than theboys at Salem House had known of my lying by the wall, slept soundly  untilmorning.\\nVery stiff and sore of foot I was in the morning, and quite dazed by the beating of\\ndrums and marching of troops, which seemed to hem me in on every  side when Iwent down towards the long narrow street. Feeling that I could go but a very littleway that day, if I were to reserve any strength for getting to my journey's end, Iresolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business. Accordingly, I tookthe jacket off, that I might learn to do without it; and carrying it under my arm,began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops.\\nIt was a likely place to sell a jacket in; for the dealers in second-hand clothes were\\nnumerous, and were, generally speaking, on the look-out for customers at their\"),\n",

But as most of them had, hanging up among their stock, an officer's\\ncoat or two, epaulettes and all, I was rendered timid by the costly nature of their\\ndealings, and walked about for a long time without offering my merchandise  toanyone.\\nThis modesty of mine directed my attention to the marine-store shops,  and  such\\nshops as Mr. Dolloby's, in preference to the regular dealers. At last I found one thatI thought looked promising, at the corner of a dirty lane, ending in an enclosure fullof stinging-nettles, against the palings of which some second-hand sailors' clothes,that seemed to have overflowed the shop, were fluttering among some  cots,  andrusty guns, and oilskin hats, and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of somany sizes that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the world.\\nInto this shop, which was low and small, and which was darkened  rather  than\\nlighted by a little window, overhung with clothes, and was descended into by somesteps, I went with a palpitating heart; which was not relieved when an  ugly  oldman, with the lower part of his face all covered with a stubbly grey beard, rushedout of a dirty den behind it, and seized me by the hair of my head. He was adreadful old man to look at, in a filthy flannel waistcoat, and smelling terribly ofrum. His bedstead, covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork, was inthe den he had come from, where another little window showed a prospect of morestinging-nettles, and a lame donkey.\\n'Oh, what do you want?' grinned this old man, in a fierce, monotonous whine. 'Oh,\\nmy eyes and limbs, what do you want? Oh, my lungs and liver, what do you want?Oh, goroo, goroo!'\\nI was so much dismayed by these words, and particularly by the repetition of the\\nlast unknown one, which was a kind of rattle in his throat, that I could make noanswer; hereupon the old man, still holding me by the hair, repeated:\\n'Oh, what do you want? Oh, my eyes and limbs, what do you want ? Oh, my lungs\\nand liver, what do you want? Oh, goroo!'—which he screwed out of himself, withan energy that made his eyes start in his head.\\n'I wanted to know,' I said, trembling, 'if you would buy a jacket.''Oh, let's see the jacket!' cried the old man. 'Oh, my heart on fire, show the jacket to\\nus! Oh, my eyes and limbs, bring the jacket out!'\\nWith that he took his trembling hands, which were like the claws of a great bird,\\nout of my hair; and put on a pair of spectacles, not at all ornamental to his inflamedeyes.\\n'Oh, how much for the jacket?' cried the old man, after examining it. 'Oh—goroo!\\n—how much for the jacket?'\\n'Half-a-crown,' I answered, recovering myself.'Oh, my lungs and liver,' cried the old man, 'no! Oh, my eyes, no! Oh, my limbs,\\nno! Eighteenpence. Goroo!'\\nEvery time he uttered this ejaculation, his eyes seemed to be in danger of starting\\nout; and every sentence he spoke, he delivered in a sort of tune, always exactly thesame, and more like a gust of wind, which begins low, mounts up high,  and fallsagain, than any other comparison I can find for it.\\n'Well,' said I, glad to have closed the bargain, 'I'll take eighteenpence.'\"),\n",

So I went outside, and sat down in the shade in a corner. And I satthere so many hours, that the shade became sunlight, and the sunlight became shadeagain, and still I sat there waiting for the money.\\nThere never was such another drunken madman in that line of business,  I  hope.\\nThat he was well known in the neighbourhood, and enjoyed the reputation ofhaving sold himself to the devil, I soon understood from the visits he received fromthe boys, who continually came skirmishing about the shop, shouting that  legend,and calling to him to bring out his gold.

Rip it  open  and  let'shave some!' This, and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose, exasperatedhim to such a degree, that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part,and flights on the part of the boys. Sometimes in his rage he would take me for oneof them, and come at me, mouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces; then,remembering me, just in time, would dive into the shop, and lie upon his bed, as Ithought from the sound of his voice, yelling in a frantic way, to  his  own  windytune, the 'Death of Nelson'; with an Oh! before every line, and innumerable Goroosinterspersed. As if this were not bad enough for me, the boys, connecting me withthe establishment, on account of the patience and perseverance with which I  satoutside, half-dressed, pelted me, and used me very ill all day.\\nHe made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange; at one  time\\ncoming out with a fishing-rod, at another with a fiddle, at another with a cockedhat, at another with a flute. But I resisted all these overtures, and sat there  indesperation; each time asking him, with tears in my eyes, for my money  or  myjacket.

(it is really impossible to express how he twisted this ejaculation out\\nof himself, as he peeped round the door-post at me, showing nothing but his craftyold head); 'will you go for fourpence?'\\nI was so faint and weary that I closed with this offer; and taking the money out of\\nhis claw, not without trembling, went away more hungry and thirsty than I had everbeen, a little before sunset.

I have associated it, ever since, with the sunny street ofCanterbury, dozing as it were in the hot light; and with the sight of its old housesand gateways, and the stately, grey Cathedral, with the rooks sailing round thetowers. When I came, at last, upon the bare, wide downs near Dover, it relieved thesolitary aspect of the scene with hope; and not until I reached that first great aim ofmy journey, and actually set foot in the town itself, on the sixth day of my flight,did it desert me. But then, strange to say, when I stood with my ragged shoes, andmy dusty, sunburnt, half-clothed figure, in the place so long desired, it seemed tovanish like a dream, and to leave me helpless and dispirited.\\nI inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first, and received various answers.\\nOne said she lived in the South Foreland Light, and had singed  her  whiskers  bydoing so; another, that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour, andcould only be visited at half-tide; a third, that she was locked up in Maidstone jailfor child-stealing; a fourth, that she was seen to mount a broom in the last highwind, and make direct for Calais. The fly-drivers, among whom I  inquired  next,were equally jocose and equally disrespectful; and the shopkeepers, not liking myappearance, generally replied, without hearing what I had to say, that they had gotnothing for me. I felt more miserable and destitute than I had done at any period ofmy running away. My money was all gone, I had nothing left to dispose of; I washungry, thirsty, and worn out; and seemed as distant from my end as if  I  hadremained in London.\\nThe morning had worn away in these inquiries, and I was sitting on the step of an\\nempty shop at a street corner, near the market-place, deliberating upon wanderingtowards those other places which had been mentioned, when a fly-driver, comingby with his carriage, dropped a horsecloth. Something good-natured in the man'sface, as I handed it up, encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me where MissTrotwood lived; though I had asked the question so often, that it almost died uponmy lips.\\n'Trotwood,' said he. 'Let me see. I know the name, too. Old lady?''Yes,' I said, 'rather.''Pretty stiff in the back?' said he, making himself upright.'Yes,' I said. 'I should think it very likely.''Carries a bag?' said he—'bag with a good deal of room in it—is gruffish, and\\ncomes down upon you, sharp?'\\nMy heart sank within me as I acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of this\\ndescription.\"),\n",

Dispatching this\\nrefreshment by the way, I went in the direction my friend had indicated, andwalked on a good distance without coming to the houses he had mentioned.  Atlength I saw some before me; and approaching them, went into a little shop (it waswhat we used to call a general shop, at home), and inquired if they could have thegoodness to tell me where Miss Trotwood lived. I addressed myself to a  manbehind the counter, who was weighing some rice for a young woman; but the latter,taking the inquiry to herself, turned round quickly.\\n'My mistress?' she said. 'What do you want with her, boy?''I want,' I replied, 'to speak to her, if you please.''To beg of her, you mean,' retorted the damsel.'No,' I said, 'indeed.' But suddenly remembering that in truth I came for no other\\npurpose, I held my peace in confusion, and felt my face burn.\\nMY aunt's handmaid, as I supposed she was from what she had said, put her rice in\\na little basket and walked out of the shop; telling me that I could follow her, if Iwanted to know where Miss Trotwood lived. I needed no second permission;though I was by this time in such a state of consternation and agitation, that mylegs shook under me. I followed the young woman, and we soon came to a veryneat little cottage with cheerful bow-windows: in front of it, a small squaregravelled court or garden full of flowers, carefully tended, and smelling deliciously.\\n'This is Miss Trotwood's,' said the young woman. 'Now you know; and  that's all  I\\nhave got to say.' With which words she hurried into the house, as if to shake off theresponsibility of my appearance; and left me standing at the garden-gate, lookingdisconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window, where a muslincurtain partly undrawn in the middle, a large round green screen or fan fastened onto the windowsill, a small table, and a great chair, suggested to me that my auntmight be at that moment seated in awful state.\\nMy shoes were by this time in a woeful condition. The soles had shed themselves\\nbit by bit, and the upper leathers had broken and burst until the  very  shape  andform of shoes had departed from them. My hat (which had served me for a night-cap, too) was so crushed and bent, that no old battered handleless saucepan on adunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it. My shirt and trousers, stained withheat, dew, grass, and the Kentish soil on which I had slept—and  torn  besides—might have frightened the birds from my aunt's garden, as I stood at the gate. Myhair had known no comb or brush since I left London. My face, neck, and hands,from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun, were burnt to a berry-brown. Fromhead to foot I was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust, as if I had comeout of a lime-kiln. In this plight, and with a strong consciousness of it, I waited tointroduce myself to, and make my first impression on, my formidable aunt.\\nThe unbroken stillness of the parlour window leading me to infer, after a while,\\nthat she was not there, I lifted up my eyes to the window above it, where I saw aflorid, pleasant-looking gentleman, with a grey head, who shut up one eye in  agrotesque manner, nodded his head at me several times, shook it at me as often,\"),\n",

I knew her immediatelyto be Miss Betsey, for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poormother had so often described her stalking up our garden at Blunderstone Rookery.\\n'Go away!' said Miss Betsey, shaking her head, and making a distant chop in the air\\nwith her knife. 'Go along! No boys here!'\\nI watched her, with my heart at my lips, as she marched to a corner of her garden,\\nand stooped to dig up some little root there. Then, without a scrap of courage, butwith a great deal of desperation, I went softly in and stood beside her, touching herwith my finger.\\n'If you please, ma'am,' I began.She started and looked up.'If you please, aunt.''EH?' exclaimed Miss Betsey, in a tone of amazement I have never heard\\napproached.\\n'If you please, aunt, I am your nephew.''Oh, Lord!' said my aunt.

I was robbed at first settingout, and have walked all the way, and have never slept in a bed since I began thejourney.' Here my self-support gave way all at once; and with a movement of myhands, intended to show her my ragged state, and call it to witness that  I  hadsuffered something, I broke into a passion of crying, which I suppose had  beenpent up within me all the week.\\nMy aunt, with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her\\ncountenance, sat on the gravel, staring at me, until I began to cry; when she got upin a great hurry, collared me, and took me into the parlour. Her first proceedingthere was to unlock a tall press, bring out several bottles, and pour  some  of  thecontents of each into my mouth. I think they must have been taken out at random,for I am sure I tasted aniseed water, anchovy sauce, and salad dressing. When shehad administered these restoratives, as I was still quite hysterical, and unable  tocontrol my sobs, she put me on the sofa, with a shawl under my head,  and  thehandkerchief from her own head under my feet, lest I should sully the cover; andthen, sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen I have already mentioned,so that I could not see her face, ejaculated at intervals, 'Mercy on us!' letting thoseexclamations off like minute guns.\\nAfter a time she rang the bell.

Indeed!''Yes,' pursued my aunt, 'and he has done a pretty piece of business.  He  has  run\\naway. Ah! His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would have run away.'

I\\nparticularly noticed that she had a very quick, bright eye. Her hair, which was grey,was arranged in two plain divisions, under what I believe would be  called a mob-cap; I mean a cap, much more common then than now, with side-pieces fasteningunder the chin. Her dress was of a lavender colour, and perfectly neat; but scantilymade, as if she desired to be as little encumbered as possible. I remember that Ithought it, in form, more like a riding-habit with the superfluous skirt cut off, thananything else. She wore at her side a gentleman's gold watch, if I might judge fromits size and make, with an appropriate chain and seals; she had some linen  at herthroat not unlike a shirt-collar, and things at her wrists like little shirt-wristbands.\\nMr. Dick, as I have already said, was grey-headed, and florid:  I should have said\\nall about him, in saying so, had not his head been curiously bowed—not by age; itreminded me of one of Mr. Creakle's boys' heads after a beating—and his  greyeyes prominent and large, with a strange kind of watery brightness in  them  thatmade me, in combination with his vacant manner, his submission to my aunt, andhis childish delight when she praised him, suspect him of being a little mad;though, if he were mad, how he came to be there puzzled me extremely. He wasdressed like any other ordinary gentleman, in a loose grey morning coat  andwaistcoat, and white trousers; and had his watch in his fob, and his money in hispockets: which he rattled as if he were very proud of it.\\nJanet was a pretty blooming girl, of about nineteen or twenty, and a perfect picture\\nof neatness. Though I made no further observation of her at the  moment,  I  maymention here what I did not discover until afterwards, namely, that she was one ofa series of protegees whom my aunt had taken into her service expressly to educatein a renouncement of mankind, and who had generally completed their abjurationby marrying the baker.\\nThe room was as neat as Janet or my aunt. As I laid down my pen, a moment since,\\nto think of it, the air from the sea came blowing in again, mixed with the perfumeof the flowers; and I saw the old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished,my aunt's inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bow-window, thedrugget-covered carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two canaries, the old china,the punchbowl full of dried rose-leaves, the tall press guarding all  sorts of bottlesand pots, and, wonderfully out of keeping with the rest, my dusty  self  upon thesofa, taking note of everything.\\nJanet had gone away to get the bath ready, when my aunt, to my great alarm,\\nbecame in one moment rigid with indignation, and had hardly voice to cry  out,'Janet! Donkeys!'\\nUpon which, Janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in flames, darted\\nout on a little piece of green in front, and warned off two saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, that had presumed to set hoof upon it; while my aunt, rushing out of thehouse, seized the bridle of a third animal laden with a bestriding child, turned him,led him forth from those sacred precincts, and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchinin attendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground.\\nTo this hour I don't know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way over that\\npatch of green; but she had settled it in her own mind that  she had, and it was allthe same to her. The one great outrage of her life, demanding to be constantlyavenged, was the passage of a donkey over that immaculate spot.

Perhaps thiswas an agreeable excitement to the donkey-boys; or perhaps the more sagacious ofthe donkeys, understanding how the case stood, delighted with constitutionalobstinacy in coming that way. I only know that there were three alarms before thebath was ready; and that on the occasion of the last and most desperate of all, I sawmy aunt engage, single-handed, with a sandy-headed lad of fifteen, and bump hissandy head against her own gate, before he seemed to comprehend what was thematter. These interruptions were of the more ridiculous to me, because she wasgiving me broth out of a table-spoon at the time (having firmly  persuaded herselfthat I was actually starving, and must receive nourishment at first in very  smallquantities), and, while my mouth was yet open to receive the spoon, she would putit back into the basin, cry 'Janet! Donkeys!' and go out to the assault.\\nThe bath was a great comfort. For I began to be sensible of acute pains in my limbs\\nfrom lying out in the fields, and was now so tired and low that I could hardly keepmyself awake for five minutes together. When I had bathed, they (I mean my auntand Janet) enrobed me in a shirt and a pair of trousers belonging to Mr. Dick, andtied me up in two or three great shawls. What sort of bundle I looked like,  I don'tknow, but I felt a very hot one. Feeling also very faint and drowsy, I  soon  laydown on the sofa again and fell asleep.\\nIt might have been a dream, originating in the fancy which had occupied my mind\\nso long, but I awoke with the impression that my aunt had come and bent over me,and had put my hair away from my face, and laid my head more comfortably, andhad then stood looking at me. The words, 'Pretty fellow,' or 'Poor fellow,' seemedto be in my ears, too; but certainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, to leadme to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt, who sat in the bow-windowgazing at the sea from behind the green fan, which was mounted on a kind ofswivel, and turned any way.\\nWe dined soon after I awoke, off a roast fowl and a pudding; I sitting at table, not\\nunlike a trussed bird myself, and moving my arms with considerable difficulty. Butas my aunt had swathed me up, I made no complaint of being inconvenienced. Allthis time I was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me; but shetook her dinner in profound silence, except when she occasionally fixed her eyes onme sitting opposite, and said, 'Mercy upon us!' which did not by any means relievemy anxiety.\\nThe cloth being drawn, and some sherry put upon the table (of which I had a glass),\\nmy aunt sent up for Mr. Dick again, who joined us, and looked as wise as he couldwhen she requested him to attend to my story, which she elicited from me,gradually, by a course of questions. During my recital, she kept her eyes on Mr.Dick, who I thought would have gone to sleep but for that,  and who, whensoeverhe lapsed into a smile, was checked by a frown from my aunt.\\n'Whatever possessed that poor unfortunate Baby, that she must go and  be married\\nagain,' said my aunt, when I had finished, 'I can't conceive.'\\n'Perhaps she fell in love with her second husband,' Mr. Dick suggested.'Fell in love!' repeated my aunt.

I then  shookhands with Mr. Dick, who shook hands with me a great many times, and hailedthis happy close of the proceedings with repeated bursts of laughter.\\n'You'll consider yourself guardian, jointly with me, of this child, Mr. Dick,' said my\\naunt.\\n'I shall be delighted,' said Mr. Dick, 'to be the guardian of David's son.''Very good,' returned my aunt, 'that's settled. I have been thinking, do you know,\\nMr. Dick, that I might call him Trotwood?'\\n'Certainly, certainly. Call him Trotwood, certainly,' said Mr. Dick. 'David's  son's\\nTrotwood.'\\n'Trotwood Copperfield, you mean,' returned my aunt.'Yes, to be sure. Yes. Trotwood Copperfield,' said Mr. Dick, a little abashed.My aunt took so kindly to the notion, that some ready-made clothes, which were\\npurchased for me that afternoon, were marked 'Trotwood Copperfield', in her ownhandwriting, and in indelible marking-ink, before I put them on; and it was settledthat all the other clothes which were ordered to be made for me (a complete outfitwas bespoke that afternoon) should be marked in the same way.\\nThus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me. Now\\nthat the state of doubt was over, I felt, for many days, like one in a dream. I neverthought that I had a curious couple of guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I neverthought of anything about myself, distinctly. The two things clearest in my mindwere, that a remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life—which seemedto lie in the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a curtain had for ever fallenon my life at Murdstone and Grinby's. No one has ever raised that curtain since. Ihave lifted it for a moment, even in this narrative, with a reluctant hand,  anddropped it gladly. The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much pain to me,with so much mental suffering and want of hope, that I have never had the courageeven to examine how long I was doomed to lead it. Whether it lasted for a year, ormore, or less, I do not know. I only know that it was, and ceased to be; and that Ihave written, and there I leave it.\"),\n",

I MAKE ANOTHER BEGINNING\\nMr. Dick and I soon became the best of friends, and very often,  when  his  day's\\nwork was done, went out together to fly the great kite. Every day of his life he hada long sitting at the Memorial, which never made the least progress, however hardhe laboured, for King Charles the First always strayed into it, sooner or later, andthen it was thrown aside, and another one begun. The patience and hope  withwhich he bore these perpetual disappointments, the mild perception he had thatthere was something wrong about King Charles the First, the feeble efforts he madeto keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled  theMemorial out of all shape, made a deep impression on me. What Mr. Dicksupposed would come of the Memorial, if it were completed; where he thought itwas to go, or what he thought it was to do; he knew no more than anybody else, Ibelieve. Nor was it at all necessary that he should trouble himself with  suchquestions, for if anything were certain under the sun, it was certain that theMemorial never would be finished. It was quite an affecting sight, I used to think,to see him with the kite when it was up a great height in the air. What he had toldme, in his room, about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on it,which were nothing but old leaves of abortive Memorials, might have been a fancywith him sometimes; but not when he was out, looking up at the kite in the sky, andfeeling it pull and tug at his hand. He never looked so serene as he did then. I usedto fancy, as I sat by him of an evening, on a green slope, and saw him watch thekite high in the quiet air, that it lifted his mind out of its  confusion,  and  bore  it(such was my boyish thought) into the skies. As he wound the string in and it camelower and lower down out of the beautiful light, until it fluttered to the ground, andlay there like a dead thing, he seemed to wake gradually out of a dream;  and  Iremember to have seen him take it up, and look about him in a lost way, as if theyhad both come down together, so that I pitied him with all my heart.\\nWhile I advanced in friendship and intimacy with Mr. Dick, I did not go backward\\nin the favour of his staunch friend, my aunt. She took so kindly to me, that, in thecourse of a few weeks, she shortened my adopted name of Trotwood into Trot; andeven encouraged me to hope, that if I went on as I had begun, I might take equalrank in her affections with my sister Betsey Trotwood.\\n'Trot,' said my aunt one evening, when the backgammon-board was placed as usual\\nfor herself and Mr. Dick, 'we must not forget your education.'\\nThis was my only subject of anxiety, and I felt quite delighted by her referring to it.'Should you like to go to school at Canterbury?' said my aunt.I replied that I should like it very much, as it was so near her.'Good,' said my aunt. 'Should you like to go tomorrow?'Being already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunt's evolutions, I was not\\nsurprised by the suddenness of the proposal, and said: 'Yes.'\\n'Good,' said my aunt again. 'Janet, hire the grey pony and chaise tomorrow morning\\nat ten o'clock, and pack up Master Trotwood's clothes tonight.'\"),\n",

But, on hearing from my aunt that I shouldsometimes come over on a Saturday, and that he could sometimes come and see meon a Wednesday, he revived; and vowed to make another kite for those occasions,of proportions greatly surpassing the present one. In the morning he wasdownhearted again, and would have sustained himself by giving me all  the moneyhe had in his possession, gold and silver too, if my aunt had not interposed, andlimited the gift to five shillings, which, at his earnest petition, were afterwardsincreased to ten. We parted at the garden-gate in a most affectionate manner, andMr. Dick did not go into the house until my aunt had driven me out of sight of it.\\nMy aunt, who was perfectly indifferent to public opinion, drove the grey  pony\\nthrough Dover in a masterly manner; sitting high and stiff like a state coachman,keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went, and making a point of not lettinghim have his own way in any respect. When we came into the country road, shepermitted him to relax a little, however; and looking at me down in  a  valley  ofcushion by her side, asked me whether I was happy?\\n'Very happy indeed, thank you, aunt,' I said.She was much gratified; and both her hands being occupied, patted me on the head\\nwith her whip.\\n'Is it a large school, aunt?' I asked.'Why, I don't know,' said my aunt. 'We are going to Mr. Wickfield's first.''Does he keep a school?' I asked.'No, Trot,' said my aunt. 'He keeps an office.'I asked for no more information about Mr. Wickfield, as she offered none, and we\\nconversed on other subjects until we came to Canterbury, where, as it was market-day, my aunt had a great opportunity of insinuating the grey pony among  carts,baskets, vegetables, and huckster's goods. The hair-breadth turns and twists  wemade, drew down upon us a variety of speeches from the people standing about,which were not always complimentary; but my aunt drove on with perfectindifference, and I dare say would have taken her own way with as much coolnessthrough an enemy's country.\\nAt length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road; a house\\nwith long low lattice-windows bulging out still farther, and beams with  carvedheads on the ends bulging out too, so that I fancied the whole house was leaningforward, trying to see who was passing on the narrow pavement below. It was quitespotless in its cleanliness. The old-fashioned brass knocker on the low arched door,ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and flowers, twinkled like a star; the twostone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered withfair linen; and all the angles and corners, and carvings and mouldings, and quaintlittle panes of glass, and quainter little windows, though as old as the hills, were aspure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills.\\nWhen the pony-chaise stopped at the door, and my eyes were intent upon the\\nhouse, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor (in alittle round tower that formed one side of the house), and quickly disappear.

He was high -shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black, with a white wisp of a neckcloth;buttoned up to the throat; and had a long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularlyattracted my attention, as he stood at the pony's head, rubbing his chin with it, andlooking up at us in the chaise.\\n'Is Mr. Wickfield at home, Uriah Heep?' said my aunt.'Mr. Wickfield's at home, ma'am,' said Uriah Heep, 'if you'll please to walk  in\\nthere'—pointing with his long hand to the room he meant.\\nWe got out; and leaving him to hold the pony, went into a long low parlour looking\\ntowards the street, from the window of which I caught a glimpse, as I went in, ofUriah Heep breathing into the pony's nostrils, and immediately covering them withhis hand, as if he were putting some spell upon him. Opposite to the tall  oldchimney-piece were two portraits: one of a gentleman with grey hair (though notby any means an old man) and black eyebrows, who was looking over some paperstied together with red tape; the other, of a lady, with a very placid  and  sweetexpression of face, who was looking at me.\\nI believe I was turning about in search of Uriah's picture, when, a door at the\\nfarther end of the room opening, a gentleman entered, at sight of whom I turned tothe first-mentioned portrait again, to make quite sure that it had not come out of itsframe. But it was stationary; and as the gentleman advanced into the light, I sawthat he was some years older than when he had had his picture painted.\\n'Miss Betsey Trotwood,' said the gentleman, 'pray walk in. I was engaged for  a\\nmoment, but you'll excuse my being busy. You know my motive. I have but one inlife.'\\nMiss Betsey thanked him, and we went into his room, which was furnished as an\\noffice, with books, papers, tin boxes, and so forth. It looked into a garden, and hadan iron safe let into the wall; so immediately over the mantelshelf, that I wondered,as I sat down, how the sweeps got round it when they swept the chimney.\\n'Well, Miss Trotwood,' said Mr. Wickfield; for I soon found that it was he, and that\\nhe was a lawyer, and steward of the estates of a rich gentleman of the county; 'whatwind blows you here? Not an ill wind, I hope?'\\n'No,' replied my aunt. 'I have not come for any law.''That's right, ma'am,' said Mr. Wickfield. 'You had better come for anything  else.'\\nHis hair was quite white now, though his eyebrows were still black. He had a veryagreeable face, and, I thought, was handsome. There was a certain richness in hiscomplexion, which I had been long accustomed, under Peggotty's tuition, toconnect with port wine; and I fancied it was in his voice too, and referred hisgrowing corpulency to the same cause. He was very cleanly dressed, in a blue coat,striped waistcoat, and nankeen trousers; and his fine frilled shirt and cambricneckcloth looked unusually soft and white, reminding my strolling fancy (I call tomind) of the plumage on the breast of a swan.\"),\n",

Ihad become, in the Murdstone and Grinby time, however short or long it may havebeen, so unused to the sports and games of boys, that  I knew I was awkward andinexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them. Whatever I had learnt,had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day to night, thatnow, when I was examined about what I knew, I knew nothing, and was put intothe lowest form of the school. But, troubled as I was, by my want of boyish skill,and of book-learning too, I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by theconsideration, that, in what I did know, I was much farther removed from  mycompanions than in what I did not. My mind ran upon what they would think,  ifthey knew of my familiar acquaintance with the King's Bench Prison? Was thereanything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with theMicawber family—all those pawnings, and sellings, and suppers—in spite ofmyself? Suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through Canterbury,wayworn and ragged, and should find me out? What would they say, who made solight of money, if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, forthe purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding? How would itaffect them, who were so innocent of London life, and London streets, to discoverhow knowing I was (and was ashamed to be) in some of the  meanest  phases  ofboth? All this ran in my head so much, on that first day at Doctor Strong's, that  Ifelt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture; shrunk within myself whensoever Iwas approached by one of my new schoolfellows; and hurried off the minute\"),\n",

He\\nwas rather a shallow sort of young gentleman, I thought, with a handsome face, arapid utterance, and a confident, bold air.

Agnes set the glasses and decanters in the same corner, andMr. Wickfield sat down to drink, and drank a good deal. Agnes played the piano tohim, sat by him, and worked and talked, and played some games at dominoes withme. In good time she made tea; and afterwards, when I brought down my books,looked into them, and showed me what she knew of them (which was  no slightmatter, though she said it was), and what was the best way to learn and understandthem. I see her, with her modest, orderly, placid manner, and I hear her beautifulcalm voice, as I write these words. The influence for all  good, which  she came toexercise over me at a later time, begins already to descend upon my breast. I lovelittle Em'ly, and I don't love Agnes—no, not at all in that way—but I feel that thereare goodness, peace, and truth, wherever Agnes is; and that the soft light  of  thecoloured window in the church, seen long ago, falls on her always, and on mewhen I am near her, and on everything around.\\nThe time having come for her withdrawal for the night, and she having left us, I\\ngave Mr. Wickfield my hand, preparatory to going away myself. But he checkedme and said: 'Should you like to stay with us, Trotwood, or to go elsewhere?'\\n'To stay,' I answered, quickly.'You are sure?''If you please. If I may!''Why, it's but a dull life that we lead here, boy, I am afraid,' he said.'Not more dull for me than Agnes, sir. Not dull at all!''Than Agnes,' he repeated, walking slowly to the great chimney-piece, and leaning\\nagainst it. 'Than Agnes!'\\nHe had drank wine that evening (or I fancied it), until his eyes were bloodshot.

When should I ever\\ntire of her!

At length he aroused  himself,  andlooked about the room until his eyes encountered mine.\\n'Stay with us, Trotwood, eh?' he said in his usual manner, and as if he  were\\nanswering something I had just said.

'I am so glad to be here.''That's a fine fellow!' said Mr. Wickfield. 'As long as you are glad to be here, you\\nshall stay here.' He shook hands with me upon it, and clapped me on the back; andtold me that when I had anything to do at night after Agnes had left us, or when Iwished to read for my own pleasure, I was free to come down to his room, if hewere there and if I desired it for company's sake, and to sit with him. I thanked himfor his consideration; and, as he went down soon afterwards, and I was not tired,went down too, with a book in my hand, to avail myself, for half-an-hour, of hispermission.\\nBut, seeing a light in the little round office, and immediately feeling myself\\nattracted towards Uriah Heep, who had a sort of fascination for me, I went in thereinstead. I found Uriah reading a great fat book, with  such demonstrative attention,that his lank forefinger followed up every line as he read, and made clammy tracksalong the page (or so I fully believed) like a snail.\\n'You are working late tonight, Uriah,' says I.'Yes, Master Copperfield,' says Uriah.As I was getting on the stool opposite, to talk to him more conveniently, I observed\\nthat he had not such a thing as a smile about him, and that he could only widen hismouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks, one on each side, to stand forone.\\n'I am not doing office-work, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah.'What work, then?' I asked.'I am improving my legal knowledge, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah. 'I am going\\nthrough Tidd's Practice. Oh, what a writer Mr. Tidd is, Master Copperfield!'\\nMy stool was such a tower of observation, that as I watched him reading on again,\\nafter this rapturous exclamation, and following up the lines with his forefinger, Iobserved that his nostrils, which were thin and pointed, with sharp dints in them,had a singular and most uncomfortable way of expanding and contractingthemselves—that they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes, which hardly evertwinkled at all.\\n'I suppose you are quite a great lawyer?' I said, after looking at him for some time.'Me, Master Copperfield?' said Uriah. 'Oh, no! I'm a very umble person.'It was no fancy of mine about his hands, I observed; for he frequently ground the\\npalms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and warm, besides often wipingthem, in a stealthy way, on his pocket-handkerchief.\"),\n",

After shaking hands with me—his hand felt like a fish, inthe dark—he opened the door into the street a very little, and crept out, and shut it,leaving me to grope my way back into the house: which cost me some trouble anda fall over his stool. This was the proximate cause, I suppose, of my  dreamingabout him, for what appeared to me to be half the night; and dreaming,  amongother things, that he had launched Mr. Peggotty's house on a piratical expedition,with a black flag at the masthead, bearing the inscription 'Tidd's  Practice',  underwhich diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em'ly to the Spanish Main,to be drowned.\\nI got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school next day, and a\\ngood deal the better next day, and so shook it off by degrees, that in less than afortnight I was quite at home, and happy, among my new companions.

It was very gravely and decorously ordered, and on a sound system; withan appeal, in everything, to the honour and good faith of the boys, and an avowedintention to rely on their possession of those qualities unless they provedthemselves unworthy of it, which worked wonders. We all felt that we had a part inthe management of the place, and in sustaining its character and dignity. Hence, wesoon became warmly attached to it—I am sure I did for one, and I never knew, inall my time, of any other boy being otherwise—and learnt with a good will,desiring to do it credit.

Also, how the Doctor's cogitating manner was attributable to his beingalways engaged in looking out for Greek roots; which, in my innocence  andignorance, I supposed to be a botanical furor on the Doctor's part, especially as healways looked at the ground when he walked about, until I understood that theywere roots of words, with a view to a new Dictionary which he had incontemplation. Adams, our head-boy, who had a turn for mathematics, had made acalculation, I was informed, of the time this Dictionary would take  in completing,on the Doctor's plan, and at the Doctor's rate of going. He considered that it mightbe done in one thousand six hundred and forty-nine years, counting from theDoctor's last, or sixty-second, birthday.\\nBut the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and it must have been a\\nbadly composed school if he had been anything else, for he was the kindest of men;with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urnsupon the wall.

It was so notorious in the house, that themasters and head-boys took pains to cut these marauders off at angles, and to getout of windows, and turn them out of the courtyard, before they could make theDoctor aware of their presence; which was sometimes happily effected within  afew yards of him, without his knowing anything of the matter, as he jogged to andfro. Outside his own domain, and unprotected, he was a very sheep for the shearers.He would have taken his gaiters off his legs, to give away. In fact, there was a storycurrent among us (I have no idea, and never had, on what authority,  but  I  havebelieved it for so many years that I feel quite certain it is true), that on a frosty day,one winter-time, he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggar -woman, whooccasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant fromdoor to door, wrapped in those garments, which were universally recognized, beingas well known in the vicinity as the Cathedral. The legend added that the onlyperson who did not identify them was the Doctor himself, who,  when  they  wereshortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little second-hand shop of  no verygood repute, where such things were taken in exchange for gin, was more thanonce observed to handle them approvingly, as if admiring some curious novelty inthe pattern, and considering them an improvement on his own.\\nIt was very pleasant to see the Doctor with his pretty young wife.

She was a little, sharp-eyed woman, who used to wear, whenshe was dressed, one unchangeable cap, ornamented with some artificial flowers,and two artificial butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers. There wasa superstition among us that this cap had come from France, and could onlyoriginate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation: but all I certainly knowabout it, is, that it always made its appearance of an evening,  wheresoever  Mrs.Markleham made HER appearance; that it was carried about to friendly meetings ina Hindoo basket; that the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly; and thatthey improved the shining hours at Doctor Strong's expense, like busy bees.\\nI observed the Old Soldier—not to adopt the name disrespectfully—to pretty good\\nadvantage, on a night which is made memorable to me by something else I shallrelate. It was the night of a little party at the Doctor's, which was given  on theoccasion of Mr. Jack Maldon's departure for India, whither he was going as a cadet,or something of that kind: Mr. Wickfield having at length arranged the business. Ithappened to be the Doctor's birthday, too. We had had a holiday, had  madepresents to him in the morning, had made a speech to him through the head-boy,and had cheered him until we were hoarse, and until he had shed tears.

I recall these things that I may be contradicted if I am wrong. Well! Then Ispoke to Annie, and I told her what had happened. I said, \"My dear, here\\'s DoctorStrong has positively been and made you the subject of a  handsome  declarationand an offer.\" Did I press it in the least? No. I said, \"Now, Annie, tell me the truththis moment; is your heart free?\" \"Mama,\" she said crying, \"I am extremelyyoung\"—which was perfectly true—\"and I hardly know if I have a  heart  at  all.\"\"Then, my dear,\" I said, \"you may rely upon it, it\\'s free. At all events, my love,\"said I, \"Doctor Strong is in an agitated state of mind, and must be answered. Hecannot be kept in his present state of suspense.\" \"Mama,\" said Annie, still crying,\"would he be unhappy without me? If he would, I honour and respect him somuch, that I think I will have him.\" So it was settled. And then, and not till then, Isaid to Annie, \"Annie, Doctor Strong will not only be your husband, but he willrepresent your late father: he will represent the head of our family, he willrepresent the wisdom and station, and I may say the means, of our family; and willbe, in short, a Boon to it.\" I used the word at the time, and I have used it again,today. If I have any merit it is consistency.\\''),\n",

But all\\npressing out of the room, in a crowd, to see what was the  matter,  we  found  herlying on the hall floor.

SOMEBODY TURNS UP\\nIt has not occurred to me to mention Peggotty since I ran away; but, of course, Iwrote her a letter almost as soon as I was housed at Dover, and another,  and  alonger letter, containing all particulars fully related, when my aunt took meformally under her protection. On my being settled at Doctor Strong's I wrote toher again, detailing my happy condition and prospects. I never could have derivedanything like the pleasure from spending the money Mr. Dick had given me, that Ifelt in sending a gold half-guinea to Peggotty, per post, enclosed in this last letter,to discharge the sum I had borrowed of her: in which epistle, not before, Imentioned about the young man with the donkey-cart.\\nTo these communications Peggotty replied as promptly, if not as concisely,  as  a\\nmerchant's clerk. Her utmost powers of expression (which were certainly not greatin ink) were exhausted in the attempt to write what she felt on the subject of myjourney. Four sides of incoherent and interjectional beginnings of  sentences,  thathad no end, except blots, were inadequate to afford her any relief. But the blotswere more expressive to me than the best composition; for they  showed  me  thatPeggotty had been crying all over the paper, and what could I have desired more?\\nI made out, without much difficulty, that she could not take quite kindly to my aunt\\nyet. The notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way. We neverknew a person, she wrote; but to think that Miss Betsey should seem to be sodifferent from what she had been thought to be, was a Moral!—that was her word.She was evidently still afraid of Miss Betsey, for she sent her grateful duty to herbut timidly; and she was evidently afraid of me, too, and entertained the probabilityof my running away again soon: if I might judge from the repeated hints she threwout, that the coach-fare to Yarmouth was always to be had of her for the asking.\"),\n",

Godknows I had no part in it while they remained there, but it pained me to think of thedear old place as altogether abandoned; of the weeds growing tall in the garden,and the fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths. I imagined how the windsof winter would howl round it, how the cold rain would beat upon the  window -glass, how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the empty rooms, watchingtheir solitude all night. I thought afresh of the grave in the churchyard, underneaththe tree: and it seemed as if the house were dead too, now, and all connected withmy father and mother were faded away.\\nThere was no other news in Peggotty's letters. Mr. Barkis was an excellent husband,\\nshe said, though still a little near; but we all had our faults, and  she  had  plenty(though I am sure I don't know what they were); and he sent his duty, and my littlebedroom was always ready for me. Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, andMrs.. Gummidge was but poorly, and little Em'ly wouldn't send her love, but saidthat Peggotty might send it, if she liked.\\nAll this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt, only reserving to myself the\\nmention of little Em'ly, to whom I instinctively felt that she would not  verytenderly incline. While I was yet new at Doctor Strong's, she made severalexcursions over to Canterbury to see me, and always at unseasonable hours: withthe view, I suppose, of taking me by surprise. But, finding me well employed, andbearing a good character, and hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school, shesoon discontinued these visits. I saw her on a Saturday, every third or fourth week,when I went over to Dover for a treat; and I saw Mr. Dick every  alternateWednesday, when he arrived by stage-coach at noon, to stay until next morning.\\nOn these occasions Mr. Dick never travelled without a leathern writing -desk,\\ncontaining a supply of stationery and the Memorial; in relation to which documenthe had a notion that time was beginning to press now, and that it really must be gotout of hand.\\nMr. Dick was very partial to gingerbread. To render his visits the more agreeable,\\nmy aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at a cake shop,  which  washampered with the stipulation that he should not be served with more than oneshilling's-worth in the course of any one day. This, and the reference of all his littlebills at the county inn where he slept, to my aunt, before they were paid, inducedme to suspect that he was only allowed to rattle his money, and not to spend it. Ifound on further investigation that this was so, or at least there was an agreementbetween him and my aunt that he should account to her for all  his disbursements.As he had no idea of deceiving her, and always desired to please her, he was thusmade chary of launching into expense. On this point, as well as on all otherpossible points, Mr. Dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and  mostwonderful of women; as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy, and always ina whisper.\\n'Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick, with an air of mystery, after imparting this confidence\\nto me, one Wednesday; 'who's the man that hides near our house and frightens her?'\\n'Frightens my aunt, sir?'Mr. Dick nodded.

'I\\ndon't think I am as old as that.'\\n'Was it in that year that the man appeared, sir?' I asked.'Why, really' said Mr. Dick, 'I don't see how it can have been in that year,\\nTrotwood. Did you get that date out of history?'\\n'Yes, sir.''I suppose history never lies, does it?' said Mr. Dick, with a gleam of hope.'Oh dear, no, sir!' I replied, most decisively. I was ingenuous and young, and  I\\nthought so.\\n'I can't make it out,' said Mr. Dick, shaking his head. 'There's  something  wrong,\\nsomewhere. However, it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting someof the trouble out of King Charles's head into my head, that  the man first came. Iwas walking out with Miss Trotwood after tea, just at dark, and there he was, closeto our house.'\\n'Walking about?' I inquired.'Walking about?' repeated Mr. Dick. 'Let me see, I must recollect a bit. N-no, no;\\nhe was not walking about.'\\nI asked, as the shortest way to get at it, what he WAS doing.'Well, he wasn't there at all,' said Mr. Dick, 'until he came up behind her, and\\nwhispered. Then she turned round and fainted, and I stood still and looked at him,and he walked away; but that he should have been hiding ever since (in the groundor somewhere), is the most extraordinary thing!'\\n'HAS he been hiding ever since?' I asked.'To be sure he has,' retorted Mr. Dick, nodding his head gravely. 'Never came out,\\ntill last night! We were walking last night, and he came up behind her again, and Iknew him again.'\\n'And did he frighten my aunt again?''All of a shiver,' said Mr. Dick, counterfeiting that affection and making  his teeth\\nchatter.

But, Trotwood, come here,' getting me close tohim, that he might whisper very softly; 'why did she give him money, boy, in  themoonlight?'\\n'He was a beggar, perhaps.'Mr. Dick shook his head, as utterly renouncing the suggestion; and having replied a\\ngreat many times, and with great confidence, 'No beggar, no beggar, no beggar, sir!'went on to say, that from his window he had afterwards, and late at night, seen my\"),\n",

As I was alreadymuch attached to Mr. Dick, and very solicitous for his welfare, my fears favouredthis supposition; and for a long time his Wednesday hardly ever came round,without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the coach-box asusual. There he always appeared, however, grey-headed, laughing, and happy; andhe never had anything more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt.\\nThese Wednesdays were the happiest days of Mr. Dick's life; they were far from\\nbeing the least happy of mine. He soon became known to every boy in the school;and though he never took an active part in any game but kite-flying, was as deeplyinterested in all our sports as anyone among us. How often have I seen him, intentupon a match at marbles or pegtop, looking on with a face of unutterable interest,and hardly breathing at the critical times! How often, at hare and hounds, have Iseen him mounted on a little knoll, cheering the whole field on to  action,  andwaving his hat above his grey head, oblivious of King Charles the Martyr's head,and all belonging to it! How many a summer hour have I known to be but blissfulminutes to him in the cricket-field! How many winter days have I seen him,standing blue-nosed, in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going downthe long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture!\\nHe was an universal favourite, and his ingenuity in little things was transcendent.\\nHe could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an idea  of.  He  couldmake a boat out of anything, from a skewer upwards. He could turn cramp-bonesinto chessmen; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards; make spoked wheelsout of cotton reels, and bird-cages of old wire. But he was greatest of all, perhaps,in the articles of string and straw; with which we were all  persuaded he could doanything that could be done by hands.\\nMr. Dick's renown was not long confined to us. After a few Wednesdays, Doctor\\nStrong himself made some inquiries of me about him, and I told him all  my aunthad told me; which interested the Doctor so much that he requested, on theoccasion of his next visit, to be presented to him. This ceremony I performed; andthe Doctor begging Mr. Dick, whensoever he should not find me at the  coachoffice, to come on there, and rest himself until our morning's work was  over,  itsoon passed into a custom for Mr. Dick to come on as a matter of course, and, ifwe were a little late, as often happened on a Wednesday, to walk about  thecourtyard, waiting for me. Here he made the acquaintance of the Doctor's beautifulyoung wife (paler than formerly, all this time; more rarely seen by me or anyone, Ithink; and not so gay, but not less beautiful), and so became more and morefamiliar by degrees, until, at last, he would come into the school and wait.

It was long before Mr. Dick ever spoketo him otherwise than bareheaded; and even when he and the Doctor had struck upquite a friendship, and would walk together by the hour, on that side of  thecourtyard which was known among us as The Doctor's Walk, Mr. Dick would pulloff his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge. How it evercame about that the Doctor began to read out scraps of the famous Dictionary, inthese walks, I never knew; perhaps he felt it all the same, at first,  as  reading  tohimself. However, it passed into a custom too; and Mr. Dick, listening with a faceshining with pride and pleasure, in his heart of hearts believed the Dictionary to bethe most delightful book in the world.\\nAs I think of them going up and down before those schoolroom windows—the\\nDoctor reading with his complacent smile, an occasional flourish of the manuscript,or grave motion of his head; and Mr. Dick listening, enchained by interest, with hispoor wits calmly wandering God knows where, upon the wings of hard words—Ithink of it as one of the pleasantest things, in a quiet way, that I have ever seen. Ifeel as if they might go walking to and fro for ever, and the world might somehowbe the better for it—as if a thousand things it makes a noise about, were not onehalf so good for it, or me.\\nAgnes was one of Mr. Dick's friends, very soon; and in often coming to the house,\\nhe made acquaintance with Uriah. The friendship between himself and meincreased continually, and it was maintained on this odd footing: that,  while  Mr.Dick came professedly to look after me as my guardian, he always consulted me inany little matter of doubt that arose, and invariably guided himself  by my  advice;not only having a high respect for my native sagacity, but considering that Iinherited a good deal from my aunt.\\nOne Thursday morning, when I was about to walk with Mr. Dick from the hotel to\\nthe coach office before going back to school (for we had an hour's school beforebreakfast), I met Uriah in the street, who reminded me of the promise I had madeto take tea with himself and his mother: adding, with a writhe, 'But I didn't expectyou to keep it, Master Copperfield, we're so very umble.'\\nI really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether I liked Uriah  or\\ndetested him; and I was very doubtful about it still, as I stood looking him in theface in the street. But I felt it quite an affront to be supposed proud, and said I onlywanted to be asked.\\n'Oh, if that's all, Master Copperfield,' said Uriah, 'and it really isn't our  umbleness\\nthat prevents you, will you come this evening? But if it is our umbleness, I hopeyou won't mind owning to it, Master Copperfield; for we are well aware of  ourcondition.'\\nI said I would mention it to Mr. Wickfield, and if he approved, as I had no doubt\\nhe would, I would come with pleasure. So, at six o'clock that  evening, which wasone of the early office evenings, I announced myself as ready, to Uriah.\\n'Mother will be proud, indeed,' he said, as we walked away together. 'Or she would\\nbe proud, if it wasn't sinful, Master Copperfield.'\\n'Yet you didn't mind supposing I was proud this morning,' I returned.'Oh dear, no, Master Copperfield!' returned Uriah.

It was a perfectly decent room, halfparlour and half kitchen, but not at all a snug room. The tea-things were set uponthe table, and the kettle was boiling on the hob. There was a chest of drawers withan escritoire top, for Uriah to read or write at of an evening; there was Uriah's bluebag lying down and vomiting papers; there was a company of Uriah's  bookscommanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard: and there were the usualarticles of furniture.

He is a broad-faced,bull-necked, young butcher, with rough red cheeks, an ill-conditioned mind, and aninjurious tongue. His main use of this tongue, is, to disparage Doctor  Strong'syoung gentlemen. He says, publicly, that if they want anything he'll give it 'em. Henames individuals among them (myself included), whom he could undertake  tosettle with one hand, and the other tied behind him.

She laughs and talks, and seems to like it. I spend a gooddeal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her. If I can bow to heronce in the day (I know her to bow to, knowing Mr. Larkins), I am happier.  Ideserve a bow now and then.

I regularly take walks outside Mr. Larkins's house in theevening, though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in, or to hear them upin the drawing-room, where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp. I even walk, ontwo or three occasions, in a sickly, spoony manner, round and round the  houseafter the family are gone to bed, wondering which is the eldest Miss Larkins'schamber (and pitching, I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins's instead); wishing that afire would burst out; that the assembled crowd would stand appalled; that I, dashingthrough them with a ladder, might rear it against her window, save her in my arms,go back for something she had left behind, and perish in the flames.

I LOOK ABOUT ME, AND MAKE\\nA DISCOVERY\\nI am doubtful whether I was at heart glad or sorry, when my school-days drew to\\nan end, and the time came for my leaving Doctor Strong's. I had been very happythere, I had a great attachment for the Doctor, and I was eminent and distinguishedin that little world. For these reasons I was sorry to go; but for  other  reasons,unsubstantial enough, I was glad. Misty ideas of being a young man  at  my  owndisposal, of the importance attaching to a young man at his own disposal, of thewonderful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal, and thewonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society, lured me away. Sopowerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind, that I seem,according to my present way of thinking, to have left school without natural regret.The separation has not made the impression on me, that other separations have. Itry in vain to recall how I felt about it, and what its circumstances were; but it isnot momentous in my recollection. I suppose the opening prospect confused me. Iknow that my juvenile experiences went for little or nothing then; and that life wasmore like a great fairy story, which I was just about to begin to read, than anythingelse.\\nMY aunt and I had held many grave deliberations on the calling to which I should\\nbe devoted. For a year or more I had endeavoured to find a satisfactory answer toher often-repeated question, 'What I would like to be?' But I had no particularliking, that I could discover, for anything. If I could have been inspired with aknowledge of the science of navigation, taken the command of a fast -sailingexpedition, and gone round the world on a triumphant voyage of discovery, I thinkI might have considered myself completely suited. But, in the absence of any suchmiraculous provision, my desire was to apply myself to some pursuit that wouldnot lie too heavily upon her purse; and to do my duty in it, whatever it might be.\\nMr. Dick had regularly assisted at our councils, with a meditative and sage\\ndemeanour. He never made a suggestion but once; and on that occasion  (I  don'tknow what put it in his head), he suddenly proposed that I should be 'a Brazier'. Myaunt received this proposal so very ungraciously, that he never ventured on asecond; but ever afterwards confined himself to looking watchfully at her for hersuggestions, and rattling his money.\\n'Trot, I tell you what, my dear,' said my aunt, one morning in the Christmas season\\nwhen I left school: 'as this knotty point is still unsettled, and as we must not makea mistake in our decision if we can help it, I think we had better take a littlebreathing-time. In the meanwhile, you must try to look at it from a new point ofview, and not as a schoolboy.'\\n'I will, aunt.''It has occurred to me,' pursued my aunt, 'that a little change, and a glimpse of life\\nout of doors, may be useful in helping you to know your own mind, and form acooler judgement.

And now, I must confess, the recollectionof what I had seen on that night when Mr. Maldon went away, first began to returnupon me with a meaning it had never had, and to trouble me. The innocent beautyof her face was not as innocent to me as it had been; I mistrusted the natural graceand charm of her manner; and when I looked at Agnes by her side, and thoughthow good and true Agnes was, suspicions arose within me that it was an ill -assorted friendship.\\nShe was so happy in it herself, however, and the other was so happy too, that they\\nmade the evening fly away as if it were but an hour. It closed in an incident whichI well remember. They were taking leave of each other, and Agnes was going toembrace her and kiss her, when Mr. Wickfield stepped between them, as if byaccident, and drew Agnes quickly away. Then I saw, as though all  the interveningtime had been cancelled, and I were still standing in the doorway on the  night ofthe departure, the expression of that night in the face of Mrs. Strong, as itconfronted his.\\nI cannot say what an impression this made upon me, or how impossible I found it,\\nwhen I thought of her afterwards, to separate her from this look, and remember herface in its innocent loveliness again. It haunted me when I got home. I seemed tohave left the Doctor's roof with a dark cloud lowering on it. The reverence that  Ihad for his grey head, was mingled with commiseration for his faith in those whowere treacherous to him, and with resentment against those who injured him. Theimpending shadow of a great affliction, and a great disgrace that had no distinctform in it yet, fell like a stain upon the quiet place where I had worked and playedas a boy, and did it a cruel wrong. I had no pleasure in thinking, any more, of thegrave old broad-leaved aloe-trees, which remained shut up in themselves a hundredyears together, and of the trim smooth grass-plot, and the stone urns, and theDoctor's walk, and the congenial sound of the Cathedral bell hovering above themall. It was as if the tranquil sanctuary of my boyhood had been sacked before myface, and its peace and honour given to the winds.\\nBut morning brought with it my parting from the old house, which Agnes had\\nfilled with her influence; and that occupied my mind sufficiently. I should be thereagain soon, no doubt; I might sleep again—perhaps often—in my old room; but thedays of my inhabiting there were gone, and the old time was past. I was heavier atheart when I packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to besent to Dover, than I cared to show to Uriah Heep; who was so officious to helpme, that I uncharitably thought him mighty glad that I was going.\\nI got away from Agnes and her father, somehow, with an indifferent show of being\\nvery manly, and took my seat upon the box of the London coach. I was so softenedand forgiving, going through the town, that I had half a mind to nod to  my  oldenemy the butcher, and throw him five shillings to drink.

I  had  abundantoccupation for my thoughts, in every conspicuous landmark on the road. When Ilooked down at the trampers whom we passed, and saw that well-remembered styleof face turned up, I felt as if the tinker's blackened hand were in the bosom of myshirt again. When we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham, and I caughta glimpse, in passing, of the lane where the old monster lived who had bought myjacket, I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where I had sat, in the sunand in the shade, waiting for my money.

A waiter showed me into the coffee-room;and a chambermaid introduced me to my small bedchamber, which smelt  like  ahackney-coach, and was shut up like a family vault.

I am of thisopinion, because, while I was reading the newspaper, I observed him behind a lowwooden partition, which was his private apartment, very busy pouring out of anumber of those vessels into one, like a chemist and druggist making up aprescription.

An elderly lady, though not very far advancedin years, with a proud carriage and a handsome face, was in the doorway as wealighted; and greeting Steerforth as 'My dearest James,' folded him in her arms. Tothis lady he presented me as his mother, and she gave me a stately welcome.\\nIt was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly. From the windows of\\nmy room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great vapour, with here andthere some lights twinkling through it. I had only time, in dressing, to glance at thesolid furniture, the framed pieces of work (done, I supposed, by Steerforth's motherwhen she was a girl), and some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hairand bodices, coming and going on the walls, as the newly-kindled fire crackled andsputtered, when I was called to dinner.\\nThere was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short figure, dark, and not\\nagreeable to look at, but with some appearance of good looks too, who attracted myattention: perhaps because I had not expected to see her; perhaps because I foundmyself sitting opposite to her; perhaps because of something really remarkable inher. She had black hair and eager black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon herlip. It was an old scar—I should rather call it seam, for it was not discoloured, andhad healed years ago—which had once cut through her mouth, downward towardsthe chin, but was now barely visible across the table, except above and on herupper lip, the shape of which it had altered. I concluded in my own mind that shewas about thirty years of age, and that she wished to be married. She was  a littledilapidated—like a house—with having been so long to let; yet had, as I have said,an appearance of good looks. Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wastingfire within her, which found a vent in her gaunt eyes.\\nShe was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother called her\\nRosa. I found that she lived there, and had been for a long time Mrs. Steerforth'scompanion. It appeared to me that she never said anything she wanted to  say,outright; but hinted it, and made a great deal more of it by this practice. Forexample, when Mrs. Steerforth observed, more in jest than earnest, that she fearedher son led but a wild life at college, Miss Dartle put in thus:\\n'Oh, really? You know how ignorant I am, and that I only ask for information, but\\nisn't it always so? I thought that kind of life was on all  hands understood to be—eh?' 'It is education for a very grave profession, if you mean that,  Rosa,'  Mrs.Steerforth answered with some coldness.\\n'Oh! Yes! That's very true,' returned Miss Dartle. 'But isn't it, though?—I want to\\nbe put right, if I am wrong—isn't it, really?'\\n'Really what?' said Mrs. Steerforth.'Oh! You mean it's not!' returned Miss Dartle. 'Well, I'm very glad to hear it! Now,\\nI know what to do! That's the advantage of asking. I shall never allow people totalk before me about wastefulness and profligacy, and so forth, in connexion withthat life, any more.'\\n'And you will be right,' said Mrs. Steerforth. 'My son's tutor is a conscientious\\ngentleman; and if I had not implicit reliance on my son, I should have reliance onhim.'\\n'Should you?' said Miss Dartle. 'Dear me! Conscientious, is he?

You can't think how  itelevates him in my opinion, to know for certain that he's really conscientious!'\\nHer own views of every question, and her correction of everything that was said to\\nwhich she was opposed, Miss Dartle insinuated in the same way: sometimes, Icould not conceal from myself, with great power, though in contradiction even ofSteerforth. An instance happened before dinner was done. Mrs. Steerforth speakingto me about my intention of going down into Suffolk, I said at hazard how glad Ishould be, if Steerforth would only go there with me;  and explaining to him that  Iwas going to see my old nurse, and Mr. Peggotty's family, I reminded him of theboatman whom he had seen at school.\\n'Oh! That bluff fellow!' said Steerforth. 'He had a son with him, hadn't he?''No. That was his nephew,' I replied; 'whom he adopted, though, as a son. He has a\\nvery pretty little niece too, whom he adopted as a daughter. In short, his house—orrather his boat, for he lives in one, on dry land—is full of people who are objectsof his generosity and kindness. You would be delighted to see that household.'\\n'Should I?' said Steerforth. 'Well, I think I should. I must see what can be done. It\\nwould be worth a journey (not to mention the pleasure of a journey with you,Daisy), to see that sort of people together, and to make one of 'em.'\\nMy heart leaped with a new hope of pleasure. But it was in reference to the tone in\\nwhich he had spoken of 'that sort of people', that Miss Dartle, whose sparkling eyeshad been watchful of us, now broke in again.\\n'Oh, but, really? Do tell me. Are they, though?' she said.'Are they what? And are who what?' said Steerforth.'That sort of people.—-Are they really animals and clods, and beings  of  another\\norder? I want to know SO much.'\\n'Why, there's a pretty wide separation between them and us,' said Steerforth, with\\nindifference. 'They are not to be expected to be as sensitive as we are. Theirdelicacy is not to be shocked, or hurt easily. They are wonderfully virtuous, I daresay—some people contend for that, at least; and I am sure I don't want to contradictthem—but they have not very fine natures, and they may be thankful that, like theircoarse rough skins, they are not easily wounded.'\\n'Really!' said Miss Dartle. 'Well, I don't know, now, when I have been better\\npleased than to hear that. It's so consoling! It's such a delight to know that,  whenthey suffer, they don't feel! Sometimes I have been quite uneasy for  that  sort ofpeople; but now I shall just dismiss the idea of them, altogether. Live and learn. Ihad my doubts, I confess, but now they're cleared up. I didn't know, and now I doknow, and that shows the advantage of asking—don't it?'\\nI believed that Steerforth had said what he had, in jest, or to draw Miss Dartle out;\\nand I expected him to say as much when she was gone, and we two were  sittingbefore the fire.

She\\nseemed to be able to speak or think about nothing else. She showed me his pictureas an infant, in a locket, with some of his baby-hair in it; she showed me hispicture as he had been when I first knew him; and she wore at her breast hispicture as he was now. All the letters he had ever written to her, she  kept  in  acabinet near her own chair by the fire; and she would have read me some of them,and I should have been very glad to hear them too, if he had not interposed, andcoaxed her out of the design.\\n'It was at Mr. Creakle's, my son tells me, that you first  became  acquainted,'  said\\nMrs. Steerforth, as she and I were talking at one table, while they playedbackgammon at another.

It was like himself.'\\nI echoed, with all my heart and soul, that it was like himself.'So my son took, of his own will, and on no compulsion, to the course in which he\\ncan always, when it is his pleasure, outstrip every competitor,' she  pursued.

Steerforth's room was next to\\nmine, and I went in to look at it. It was a picture of comfort, full of easy-chairs,\\ncushions and footstools, worked by his mother's hand, and with no sort of  thingomitted that could help to render it complete. Finally, her handsome features lookeddown on her darling from a portrait on the wall, as if it were even something to herthat her likeness should watch him while he slept.\\nI found the fire burning clear enough in my room by this time, and the curtains\\ndrawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a very snug appearance. Isat down in a great chair upon the hearth to meditate on my happiness; and hadenjoyed the contemplation of it for some time, when I found a  likeness  of  MissDartle looking eagerly at me from above the chimney-piece.\\nIt was a startling likeness, and necessarily had a startling look. The painter hadn't\\nmade the scar, but I made it; and there it was, coming and going; now confined tothe upper lip as I had seen it at dinner, and now showing the whole extent of thewound inflicted by the hammer, as I had seen it when she was passionate.\\nI wondered peevishly why they couldn't put her anywhere else instead of quartering\\nher on me. To get rid of her, I undressed quickly, extinguished my light, and wentto bed. But, as I fell asleep, I could not forget that she was still there looking, 'Is itreally, though? I want to know'; and when I awoke in the night, I found that I wasuneasily asking all sorts of people in my dreams whether it really was  or  not—without knowing what I meant.\\nCHAPTER 21. LITTLE EM'LY\\nThere was a servant in that house, a man who, I understood, was usually withSteerforth, and had come into his service at the University, who was in appearancea pattern of respectability. I believe there never existed in his station a morerespectable-looking man. He was taciturn, soft-footed, very quiet in his manner,deferential, observant, always at hand when wanted, and never near when notwanted; but his great claim to consideration was his respectability. He had not apliant face, he had rather a stiff neck, rather a tight smooth head with short hairclinging to it at the sides, a soft way of speaking, with a peculiar habit ofwhispering the letter S so distinctly, that he seemed to use it oftener than any otherman; but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable. If his nose had beenupside-down, he would have made that respectable. He surrounded himself with anatmosphere of respectability, and walked secure in it. It would have been next toimpossible to suspect him of anything wrong, he was so thoroughly  respectable.Nobody could have thought of putting him in a livery, he was so highlyrespectable. To have imposed any derogatory work upon him, would have been toinflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable man. And  of  this,  Inoticed—the women-servants in the household were so intuitively conscious, thatthey always did such work themselves, and generally while he read the paper bythe pantry fire.\\nSuch a self-contained man I never saw. But in that quality, as in every other he\\npossessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable. Even the fact that no oneknew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his respectability. Nothing could\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'david-Cooper.pdf', 'page': 207}, page_content=\"be objected against his surname, Littimer, by which he was known.  Peter  might\\nhave been hanged, or Tom transported; but Littimer was perfectly respectable.\\nIt was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability in the\\nabstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence. How old he washimself, I could not guess—and that again went to his credit on the same score; forin the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well  asthirty.\\nLittimer was in my room in the morning before I was up, to bring me that\\nreproachful shaving-water, and to put out my clothes. When I undrew the curtainsand looked out of bed, I saw him, in an equable temperature of respectability,unaffected by the east wind of January, and not even breathing frostily, standingmy boots right and left in the first dancing position, and blowing specks of dust offmy coat as he laid it down like a baby.\\nI gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was. He took out of his\\npocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and preventing the springwith his thumb from opening far, looked in at the face as if he were consulting anoracular oyster, shut it up again, and said, if I pleased, it was half past eight.\\n'Mr. Steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested, sir.''Thank you,' said I, 'very well indeed. Is Mr. Steerforth quite well?''Thank you, sir, Mr. Steerforth is tolerably well.' Another of his characteristics—no\\nuse of superlatives. A cool calm medium always.\\n'Is there anything more I can have the honour of doing for you, sir? The warning-\\nbell will ring at nine; the family take breakfast at half past nine.'\\n'Nothing, I thank you.''I thank YOU, sir, if you please'; and with that, and with a little inclination of his\\nhead when he passed the bed-side, as an apology for correcting me, he went out,shutting the door as delicately as if I had just fallen into a sweet sleep on which mylife depended.\\nEvery morning we held exactly this conversation: never any more, and never any\\nless: and yet, invariably, however far I might have been lifted out of myself over-night, and advanced towards maturer years, by Steerforth's companionship, or Mrs.Steerforth's confidence, or Miss Dartle's conversation, in the presence of this mostrespectable man I became, as our smaller poets sing, 'a boy again'.\\nHe got horses for us; and Steerforth, who knew everything, gave me lessons  in\\nriding. He provided foils for us, and Steerforth gave me lessons in fencing—gloves,and I began, of the same master, to improve in boxing. It gave me no manner  ofconcern that Steerforth should find me a novice in these sciences, but I never couldbear to show my want of skill before the respectable Littimer. I had no reason  tobelieve that Littimer understood such arts himself; he never led me to supposeanything of the kind, by so much as the vibration of one of his respectableeyelashes; yet whenever he was by, while we were practising, I felt myself thegreenest and most inexperienced of mortals.\\nI am particular about this man, because he made a particular effect on me  at that\\ntime, and because of what took place thereafter.\\nThe week passed away in a most delightful manner.

A dashing way hehad of treating me like a plaything, was more agreeable to me than any behaviourhe could have adopted. It reminded me of our old acquaintance; it  seemed  thenatural sequel of it; it showed me that he was unchanged; it relieved  me  of  anyuneasiness I might have felt, in comparing my merits  with his, and measuring myclaims upon his friendship by any equal standard; above all, it was a  familiar,unrestrained, affectionate demeanour that he used towards no one else. As he hadtreated me at school differently from all the rest, I joyfully believed that he treatedme in life unlike any other friend he had. I believed that  I was nearer to his heartthan any other friend, and my own heart warmed with attachment to him. He madeup his mind to go with me into the country, and the day arrived for our departure.He had been doubtful at first whether to take Littimer or not, but decided to leavehim at home. The respectable creature, satisfied with his lot whatever it  was,arranged our portmanteaux on the little carriage that was to take us into London, asif they were intended to defy the shocks of ages, and received my  modestlyproffered donation with perfect tranquillity.\\nWe bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, with many thanks on my  part,\\nand much kindness on the devoted mother's. The last thing I saw  was  Littimer'sunruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent conviction that I was very youngindeed.\\nWhat I felt, in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places, I shall  not\\nendeavour to describe. We went down by the Mail. I was so concerned, I recollect,even for the honour of Yarmouth, that when Steerforth said, as we drove throughits dark streets to the inn, that, as well as he could make out, it was a good, queer,out-of-the-way kind of hole, I was highly pleased. We went to bed on our arrival (Iobserved a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend theDolphin as we passed that door), and breakfasted late in the morning. Steerforth,who was in great spirits, had been strolling about the beach before I was up, andhad made acquaintance, he said, with half the boatmen in the place. Moreover, hehad seen, in the distance, what he was sure must be the identical house  of  Mr.Peggotty, with smoke coming out of the chimney; and had had a great mind, hetold me, to walk in and swear he was myself grown out of knowledge.\\n'When do you propose to introduce me there, Daisy?' he said. 'I am at  your\\ndisposal. Make your own arrangements.'\\n'Why, I was thinking that this evening would be a good time, Steerforth, when they\\nare all sitting round the fire. I should like you to see it when it's snug,  it's such  acurious place.'\\n'So be it!' returned Steerforth. 'This evening.''I shall not give them any notice that we are here, you know,' said I, delighted. 'We\\nmust take them by surprise.'\\n'Oh, of course! It's no fun,' said Steerforth, 'unless we take them by surprise. Let us\\nsee the natives in their aboriginal condition.'\\n'Though they ARE that sort of people that you mentioned,' I returned.'Aha! What! you recollect my skirmishes with Rosa, do you?' he exclaimed with a\\nquick look. 'Confound the girl, I am half afraid of her. She's like a goblin to me.But never mind her.

'Suppose I deliver you up to be cried\\nover for a couple of hours. Is that long enough?'\\nI answered, laughing, that I thought we might get through it in that time, but that he\\nmust come also; for he would find that his renown had preceded him, and that  hewas almost as great a personage as I was.\\n'I'll come anywhere you like,' said Steerforth, 'or do anything you like. Tell me\\nwhere to come to; and in two hours I'll produce myself in any  state  you please,sentimental or comical.'\\nI gave him minute directions for finding the residence of Mr. Barkis, carrier to\\nBlunderstone and elsewhere; and, on this understanding, went out alone. There wasa sharp bracing air; the ground was dry; the sea was crisp and clear; the sun wasdiffusing abundance of light, if not much warmth; and everything was  fresh  andlively. I was so fresh and lively myself, in the pleasure of being there, that I couldhave stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands with them.\\nThe streets looked small, of course. The streets that we have only seen as children\\nalways do, I believe, when we go back to them. But I had forgotten  nothing  inthem, and found nothing changed, until I came to Mr. Omer's shop. OMER ANDJoram was now written up, where OMER used to be; but the inscription, DRAPER,TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &c., remained as it was.\\nMy footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop door, after I had read these\\nwords from over the way, that I went across the road and looked in. There was apretty woman at the back of the shop, dancing a little child in her arms,  whileanother little fellow clung to her apron. I had no difficulty in  recognizing  eitherMinnie or Minnie's children. The glass door of the parlour was not open; but in theworkshop across the yard I could faintly hear the old tune playing, as if it had neverleft off.\\n'Is Mr. Omer at home?' said I, entering. 'I should like to see him, for a moment, if\\nhe is.'\\n'Oh yes, sir, he is at home,' said Minnie; 'the weather don't suit his asthma out of\\ndoors. Joe, call your grandfather!'\\nThe little fellow, who was holding her apron, gave such a lusty shout, that the\\nsound of it made him bashful, and he buried his face in her skirts, to  her  greatadmiration. I heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us, and soon Mr.Omer, shorter-winded than of yore, but not much older-looking, stood before me.\\n'Servant, sir,' said Mr. Omer. 'What can I do for you, sir?' 'You can shake hands\\nwith me, Mr. Omer, if you please,' said I, putting out my own. 'You  were  verygood-natured to me once, when I am afraid I didn't show that I thought so.'\\n'Was I though?' returned the old man. 'I'm glad to hear it, but  I  don't  remember\\nwhen.

When we got outside the door,\\nPeggotty informed me that Mr. Barkis, being now \\'a little nearer\\' than he used tobe, always resorted to this same device before producing a single coin  from  hisstore; and that he endured unheard-of agonies in crawling out of  bed  alone,  andtaking it from that unlucky box. In effect, we presently heard him utteringsuppressed groans of the most dismal nature, as this magpie proceeding racked himin every joint; but while Peggotty\\'s eyes were full of compassion for him, she saidhis generous impulse would do him good, and it was better not to check it. So hegroaned on, until he had got into bed again, suffering, I have no doubt,  amartyrdom; and then called us in, pretending to have just woke up from arefreshing sleep, and to produce a guinea from under his pillow. His satisfaction inwhich happy imposition on us, and in having preserved the impenetrable secret ofthe box, appeared to be a sufficient compensation to him for all his tortures.\\nI prepared Peggotty for Steerforth\\'s arrival and it was not long before he came. I am\\npersuaded she knew no difference between his having been a personal benefactorof hers, and a kind friend to me, and that she would have received him with theutmost gratitude and devotion in any case.

Hismanner to me, alone, would have won her. But, through all these causes combined,I sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him before he left the house thatnight.\\nHe stayed there with me to dinner—if I were to say willingly, I  should  not  half\\nexpress how readily and gaily. He went into Mr. Barkis\\'s room like light and air,brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather.

Ifanyone had told me, then, that all this was a brilliant game, played for theexcitement of the moment, for the employment of high spirits, in the thoughtlesslove of superiority, in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what wasworthless to him, and next minute thrown away—I say, if anyone had told me sucha lie that night, I wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would havefound a vent!

We\\nwere very much together, I need not say; but occasionally we were asunder  forsome hours at a time. He was a good sailor, and I was but an indifferent one; andwhen he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty, which was a favourite amusement ofhis, I generally remained ashore. My occupation of Peggotty's spare-room put  aconstraint upon me, from which he was free: for, knowing how assiduously  sheattended on Mr. Barkis all day, I did not like to remain out late at night; whereasSteerforth, lying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour.  Thus itcame about, that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at Mr.Peggotty's house of call, 'The Willing Mind', after I was in bed, and of his beingafloat, wrapped in fishermen's clothes, whole moonlight nights, and coming  backwhen the morning tide was at flood. By this time, however, I knew that his restlessnature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather, as inany other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him; so none of hisproceedings surprised me.\\nAnother cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally an interest in\\ngoing over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood;while Steerforth, after being there once, had naturally no great interest in goingthere again. Hence, on three or four days that I can at once recall,  we  went  ourseveral ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. I had no ideahow he employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he wasvery popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himselfwhere another man might not have found one.\\nFor my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to  recall  every\\nyard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots, of which I nevertired. I haunted them, as my memory had often done, and lingered among them asmy younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away. The grave beneath  thetree, where both my parents lay—on which I had looked out, when it was myfather's only, with such curious feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood,so desolate, when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby—thegrave which Peggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made agarden of, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the churchyard path, in aquiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names upon the  stone  as  Iwalked to and fro, startled by the sound of the church-bell when it struck the hour,for it was like a departed voice to me. My reflections at these times were alwaysassociated with the figure I was to make in life, and the distinguished things I wasto do. My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as ifI had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother's side.\\nThere were great changes in my old home. The ragged nests, so long deserted by\\nthe rooks, were gone; and the trees were lopped and topped out of theirremembered shapes. The garden had run wild, and half the windows of the housewere shut up. It was occupied, but only by a poor lunatic gentleman, and the peoplewho took care of him. He was always sitting at my little window, looking out intothe churchyard; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon anyof the fancies that used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out ofthat same little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly feeding inthe light of the rising sun.\\nOur old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America, and the\"),\n",

I was still looking at the doorway,\\nthinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her appearance, when, to myinfinite astonishment, there came waddling round a sofa which stood between meand it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or forty-five, with a very large head and face,a pair of roguish grey eyes, and such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself tolay a finger archly against her snub nose, as she ogled Steerforth, she was obligedto meet the finger half-way, and lay her nose against it. Her chin, which was whatis called a double chin, was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of herbonnet, bow and all. Throat she had none; waist she had none; legs she had none,worth mentioning; for though she was more than full-sized down to where herwaist would have been, if she had had any, and though she terminated, as humanbeings generally do, in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a common-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on the seat. This lady—dressed inan off-hand, easy style; bringing her nose and her forefinger together, with thedifficulty I have described; standing with her head necessarily on one  side,  and,with one of her sharp eyes shut up, making an uncommonly knowing face—afterogling Steerforth for a few moments, broke into a torrent of words.\\n'What! My flower!' she pleasantly began, shaking her large head at him.  'You're\\nthere, are you! Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far awayfrom home? Up to mischief, I'll be bound. Oh, you're a downy fellow, Steerforth,so you are, and I'm another, ain't I? Ha, ha, ha! You'd have betted a hundred poundto five, now, that you wouldn't have seen me here, wouldn't you?

'What  aworld of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain't it!'\\nThis was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a hand came away\\nfrom the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag again.\\n'What do you mean, Miss Mowcher?' said Steerforth.'Ha! ha! ha!

Thus assisted,  she  skippeddown with much agility, and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet.\\n\\'The fee,\\' said Steerforth, \\'is—\\'\\'Five bob,\\' replied Miss Mowcher, \\'and dirt cheap, my chicken.

I CORROBORATE Mr. DICK,\\nAND CHOOSE A PROFESSION\\nWhen I awoke in the morning I thought very much of little Em'ly, and her emotion\\nlast night, after Martha had left. I felt as if I had come into the knowledge of thosedomestic weaknesses and tendernesses in a sacred confidence, and that to disclosethem, even to Steerforth, would be wrong. I had no gentler feeling towards anyonethan towards the pretty creature who had been my playmate, and whom I havealways been persuaded, and shall always be persuaded, to my dying day,  I  thendevotedly loved. The repetition to any ears—even to Steerforth's—of what she hadbeen unable to repress when her heart lay open to me by an accident, I felt wouldbe a rough deed, unworthy of myself, unworthy of the light of our pure childhood,which I always saw encircling her head. I made a resolution, therefore, to keep it inmy own breast; and there it gave her image a new grace.\\nWhile we were at breakfast, a letter was delivered to me from my aunt.  As  it\\ncontained matter on which I thought Steerforth could advise me as well as anyone,and on which I knew I should be delighted to consult him, I resolved to make it asubject of discussion on our journey home. For the present we had enough to do, intaking leave of all our friends. Mr. Barkis was far from being the last among them,in his regret at our departure; and I believe would even have opened the box again,and sacrificed another guinea, if it would have kept us eight-and-forty hours inYarmouth. Peggotty and all her family were full of grief at our going. The wholehouse of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good-bye; and there were so manyseafaring volunteers in attendance on Steerforth, when our portmanteaux  went  tothe coach, that if we had had the baggage of a regiment with us, we should hardlyhave wanted porters to carry it. In a word, we departed to the regret and admirationof all concerned, and left a great many people very sorry behind US.\\nDo you stay long here, Littimer?' said I, as he stood waiting to see the coach start.'No, sir,' he replied; 'probably not very long, sir.''He can hardly say, just now,' observed Steerforth, carelessly. 'He knows what he\\nhas to do, and he'll do it.'\\n'That I am sure he will,' said I.Littimer touched his hat in acknowledgement of my good opinion, and I felt about\\neight years old. He touched it once more, wishing us a good journey;  and we lefthim standing on the pavement, as respectable a mystery as any pyramid in Egypt.\\nFor some little time we held no conversation, Steerforth being unusually silent, and\\nI being sufficiently engaged in wondering, within myself, when I should see the oldplaces again, and what new changes might happen to me or them in the meanwhile.At length Steerforth, becoming gay and talkative in a moment, as he could becomeanything he liked at any moment, pulled me by the arm:\\n'Find a voice, David. What about that letter you were speaking of at breakfast?''Oh!' said I, taking it out of my pocket. 'It's from my aunt.''And what does she say, requiring consideration?''Why, she reminds me, Steerforth,' said I, 'that I came out on this expedition to look\\nabout me, and to think a little.'\"),\n",

He is a  functionary  whoseexistence, in the natural course of things, would have terminated about two hundredyears ago. I can tell you best what he is, by telling you what Doctors\\' Commons is.It\\'s a little out-of-the-way place, where they administer what is called ecclesiasticallaw, and play all kinds of tricks with obsolete old monsters of acts of Parliament,which three-fourths of the world know nothing about, and the other fourthsupposes to have been dug up, in a fossil state, in the days of the Edwards. It\\'s aplace that has an ancient monopoly in suits about people\\'s wills and people\\'smarriages, and disputes among ships and boats.\\'\\n\\'Nonsense, Steerforth!\\' I exclaimed. \\'You don\\'t mean to say that there is any affinity\\nbetween nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters?\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t, indeed, my dear boy,\\' he returned; \\'but I mean to say that they are managed\\nand decided by the same set of people, down in that same Doctors\\' Commons.

They plume them-selves on theirgentility there, I can tell you, if that's any satisfaction.'\\nI made allowance for Steerforth's light way of treating the subject, and, considering\\nit with reference to the staid air of gravity and antiquity which I associated withthat 'lazy old nook near St. Paul's Churchyard', did not feel indisposed towards myaunt's suggestion; which she left to my free decision, making  no scruple  of tellingme that it had occurred to her, on her lately visiting her own proctor in Doctors'Commons for the purpose of settling her will in my favour.\\n'That's a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt, at all events,' said Steerforth,\\nwhen I mentioned it; 'and one deserving of all encouragement. Daisy, my advice isthat you take kindly to Doctors' Commons.'\\nI quite made up my mind to do so. I then told Steerforth that my aunt was in town\\nawaiting me (as I found from her letter), and that she had taken lodgings  for  aweek at a kind of private hotel at Lincoln's Inn Fields, where there  was  a  stonestaircase, and a convenient door in the roof; my aunt being firmly  persuaded thatevery house in London was going to be burnt down every night.\\nWe achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to  Doctors'\\nCommons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a proctor there,which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and whimsical lights, that madeus both merry.

I am bent upon it—so is Dick. I should like somepeople that I know to hear Dick's conversation on the subject. Its sagacity iswonderful. But no one knows the resources of that man's intellect, except myself!'\\nShe stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went on:'It's in vain, Trot, to recall the past, unless it works some influence upon the\\npresent. Perhaps I might have been better friends with your poor father. Perhaps Imight have been better friends with that poor child your mother, even after yoursister Betsey Trotwood disappointed me. When you came to me, a little runawayboy, all dusty and way-worn, perhaps I thought so. From that time until now, Trot,you have ever been a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure. I have no other claimupon my means; at least'—here to my surprise she hesitated, and was confused—'no, I have no other claim upon my means—and you are my adopted child. Onlybe a loving child to me in my age, and bear with my whims and fancies; and youwill do more for an old woman whose prime of life was not so happy orconciliating as it might have been, than ever that old woman did for you.'\\nIt was the first time I had heard my aunt refer to her past history.  There  was  a\\nmagnanimity in her quiet way of doing so, and of dismissing it, which would haveexalted her in my respect and affection, if anything could.\\n'All is agreed and understood between us, now, Trot,' said my aunt, 'and we need\\ntalk of this no more. Give me a kiss, and we'll go to the Commons after breakfasttomorrow.'\\nWe had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed. I slept in a room on the\\nsame floor with my aunt's, and was a little disturbed in the course of the night byher knocking at my door as often as she was agitated by a distant sound ofhackney-coaches or market-carts, and inquiring, 'if I heard the engines?' Buttowards morning she slept better, and suffered me to do so too.\\nAt about mid-day, we set out for the office of Messrs Spenlow and Jorkins, in\\nDoctors' Commons. My aunt, who had this other general opinion in reference toLondon, that every man she saw was a pickpocket, gave me her purse to carry forher, which had ten guineas in it and some silver.\\nWe made a pause at the toy shop in Fleet Street, to see the giants  of  Saint\\nDunstan's strike upon the bells—we had timed our going, so as to catch them at it,at twelve o'clock—and then went on towards Ludgate Hill, and St. Paul'sChurchyard. We were crossing to the former place, when I found that my auntgreatly accelerated her speed, and looked frightened. I observed, at the same time,that a lowering ill-dressed man who had stopped and stared at us in passing, a littlebefore, was coming so close after us as to brush against her.\\n'Trot!

'He is nothing but a sturdy beggar.''You don't know what he is!' replied my aunt. 'You don't know who  he  is!

I replied.'Yes,' rejoined my aunt. 'I must go alone. I must go with him.''With him, aunt? This man?''I am in my senses,' she replied, 'and I tell you I must. Get mea coach!'However much astonished I might be, I was sensible that I had no right  to refuse\\ncompliance with such a peremptory command. I hurried away a few paces,  andcalled a hackney-chariot which was passing empty. Almost before I could let downthe steps, my aunt sprang in, I don't know how, and the man followed. She wavedher hand to me to go away, so earnestly, that, all confounded as  I  was,  I  turnedfrom them at once. In doing so, I heard her say to the coachman, 'Drive anywhere!Drive straight on!' and presently the chariot passed me, going up the hill.\\nWhat Mr. Dick had told me, and what I had supposed to be a delusion of his, now\\ncame into my mind. I could not doubt that this person was the person of whom hehad made such mysterious mention, though what the nature of his hold upon myaunt could possibly be, I was quite unable to imagine. After half an hour's coolingin the churchyard, I saw the chariot coming back. The driver stopped beside me,and my aunt was sitting in it alone.\\nShe had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite  prepared for\\nthe visit we had to make. She desired me to get into the chariot,  and  to  tell  thecoachman to drive slowly up and down a little while. She said no more, except, 'Mydear child, never ask me what it was, and don't refer to it,' until she had perfectlyregained her composure, when she told me she was quite herself now, and wemight get out. On her giving me her purse to pay the driver, I found that all  theguineas were gone, and only the loose silver remained.\\nDoctors' Commons was approached by a little low archway. Before we had taken\\nmany paces down the street beyond it, the noise of the city seemed to melt, as if bymagic, into a softened distance. A few dull courts and narrow ways brought us tothe sky-lighted offices of Spenlow and Jorkins; in the vestibule of which temple,accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking, three or four clerks wereat work as copyists. One of these, a little dry man, sitting by himself, who wore astiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to receive myaunt, and show us into Mr. Spenlow's room.\"),\n",

The furniture of the room was old-fashioned and dusty; and thegreen baize on the top of the writing-table had lost all its colour, and was  aswithered and pale as an old pauper. There were a great many bundles of papers onit, some endorsed as Allegations, and some (to my surprise) as Libels, and some asbeing in the Consistory Court, and some in the Arches Court, and some in thePrerogative Court, and some in the Admiralty Court, and some in  the  Delegates'Court; giving me occasion to wonder much, how many Courts there might be in thegross, and how long it would take to understand them all. Besides these, there weresundry immense manuscript Books of Evidence taken on affidavit, strongly bound,and tied together in massive sets, a set to each cause, as if every cause were  ahistory in ten or twenty volumes. All this looked tolerably expensive,  I  thought,and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor's business. I was  casting  my  eyeswith increasing complacency over these and many similar objects, when hastyfootsteps were heard in the room outside, and Mr. Spenlow, in a black gowntrimmed with white fur, came hurrying in, taking off his hat as he came.\\nHe was a little light-haired gentleman, with undeniable boots, and the  stiffest  of\\nwhite cravats and shirt-collars. He was buttoned up, mighty trim and tight, andmust have taken a great deal of pains with his whiskers, which were  accuratelycurled. His gold watch-chain was so massive, that a fancy came across me, that heought to have a sinewy golden arm, to draw it out with, like those which are put upover the goldbeaters' shops. He was got up with such care, and was so stiff, that hecould hardly bend himself; being obliged, when he glanced at some papers on hisdesk, after sitting down in his chair, to move his whole body, from  the bottom ofhis spine, like Punch.\\nI had previously been presented by my aunt, and had been courteously received.\\nHe now said:\\n'And so, Mr. Copperfield, you think of entering into our profession? I casually\\nmentioned to Miss Trotwood, when I had the pleasure of an interview with her theother day,'—with another inclination of his body—Punch again—'that there was avacancy here. Miss Trotwood was good enough to mention that she had a nephewwho was her peculiar care, and for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly inlife. That nephew, I believe, I have now the pleasure of'—Punch again. I bowedmy acknowledgements, and said, my aunt had mentioned to me that there was thatopening, and that I believed I should like it very much. That I was strongly inclinedto like it, and had taken immediately to the proposal. That I could not absolutelypledge myself to like it, until I knew something more about it. That although it waslittle else than a matter of form, I presumed I should have an opportunity of tryinghow I liked it, before I bound myself to it irrevocably.\\n'Oh surely! surely!' said Mr. Spenlow. 'We always, in this house, propose a month\\n—an initiatory month. I should be happy, myself, to propose two months—three—an indefinite period, in fact—but I have a partner.

Mr. Jorkins is immovable.'\\nI was quite dismayed by the idea of this terrible Jorkins. But I found out afterwards\\nthat he was a mild man of a heavy temperament, whose place in the business wasto keep himself in the background, and be constantly exhibited by name as themost obdurate and ruthless of men. If a clerk wanted his salary raised, Mr. Jorkinswouldn't listen to such a proposition. If a client were slow to settle his bill of costs,Mr. Jorkins was resolved to have it paid; and however painful these things mightbe (and always were) to the feelings of Mr. Spenlow, Mr. Jorkins would have  hisbond. The heart and hand of the good angel Spenlow would have been alwaysopen, but for the restraining demon Jorkins.

When we had got so far, Mr. Spenlow offered to take me intoCourt then and there, and show me what sort of place it was. As I  was  willingenough to know, we went out with this object, leaving my aunt behind; who wouldtrust herself, she said, in no such place, and who, I think, regarded all Courts ofLaw as a sort of powder-mills that might blow up at any time.\\nMr. Spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave brick\\nhouses, which I inferred, from the Doctors' names upon the doors, to be the officialabiding-places of the learned advocates of whom Steerforth had told me; and into alarge dull room, not unlike a chapel to my thinking, on the left hand. The upper partof this room was fenced off from the rest; and there, on the two sides of  a raisedplatform of the horse-shoe form, sitting on easy old-fashioned dining-room chairs,were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs, whom I found to be  theDoctors aforesaid. Blinking over a little desk like a pulpit-desk, in the curve of thehorse-shoe, was an old gentleman, whom, if I had seen him in an aviary, I shouldcertainly have taken for an owl, but who, I learned, was the presiding judge. In thespace within the horse-shoe, lower than these, that is to say, on about  the level ofthe floor, were sundry other gentlemen, of Mr. Spenlow's rank, and  dressed  likehim in black gowns with white fur upon them, sitting at a long green table. Theircravats were in general stiff, I thought, and their looks haughty; but in  this  lastrespect I presently conceived I had done them an injustice, for when two or three ofthem had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary, I never sawanything more sheepish. The public, represented by a boy with  a comforter, and ashabby-genteel man secretly eating crumbs out of his coat pockets, was warmingitself at a stove in the centre of the Court. The languid stillness of the place wasonly broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the Doctors, whowas wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence, and stopping to put up,from time to time, at little roadside inns of argument on the journey.

We had another long talk about my plans, when we weresafely housed; and as I knew she was anxious to get home, and, between fire, food,and pickpockets, could never be considered at her ease for half-an-hour in London,I urged her not to be uncomfortable on my account, but to leave me to take care ofmyself.\\n'I have not been here a week tomorrow, without considering that too, my dear,' she\\nreturned. 'There is a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the Adelphi, Trot,which ought to suit you to a marvel.'\\nWith this brief introduction, she produced from her pocket an advertisement,\\ncarefully cut out of a newspaper, setting forth that in Buckingham Street in  theAdelphi there was to be let furnished, with a view of the river, a  singularlydesirable, and compact set of chambers, forming a genteel residence for a younggentleman, a member of one of the Inns of Court, or otherwise, with immediatepossession.

'We'll go and look at 'em.'\\nAway we went. The advertisement directed us to apply to Mrs. Crupp on the\\npremises, and we rung the area bell, which we supposed to communicate with Mrs.Crupp. It was not until we had rung three or four times that we could prevail onMrs. Crupp to communicate with us, but at last she appeared, being a stout ladywith a flounce of flannel petticoat below a nankeen gown.\\n'Let us see these chambers of yours, if you please, ma'am,' said my aunt.'For this gentleman?' said Mrs. Crupp, feeling in her pocket for her keys.'Yes, for my nephew,' said my aunt.'And a sweet set they is for sich!' said Mrs. Crupp.So we went upstairs.They were on the top of the house—a great point with my aunt, being near the fire-\\nescape—and consisted of a little half-blind entry where you could see hardlyanything, a little stone-blind pantry where you could see nothing at all, a sitting-room, and a bedroom.

Not to lengthen theseparticulars, I need only add, that she made a handsome provision for all  mypossible wants during my month of trial; that Steerforth, to my greatdisappointment and hers too, did not make his appearance before she went away;that I saw her safely seated in the Dover coach, exulting in the coming discomfitureof the vagrant donkeys, with Janet at her side; and that when the coach was gone, Iturned my face to the Adelphi, pondering on the old days when I used  to  roamabout its subterranean arches, and on the happy changes which had brought me tothe surface.\\nCHAPTER 24.

It was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out, and tocome and go without a word to anyone, and to ring Mrs. Crupp up, gasping, fromthe depths of the earth, when I wanted her—and when she was disposed to  come.All this, I say, was wonderfully fine; but I must say, too, that there  were  timeswhen it was very dreary.\\nIt was fine in the morning, particularly in the fine mornings. It looked a very fresh,\\nfree life, by daylight: still fresher, and more free, by sunlight. But as the daydeclined, the life seemed to go down too.

Mrs.Steerforth was very glad to see me, and said that he had gone away with one of hisOxford friends to see another who lived near St. Albans, but that she expected himto return tomorrow. I was so fond of him, that I felt quite jealous of his Oxfordfriends.\\nAs she pressed me to stay to dinner, I remained, and I believe we  talked  about\\nnothing but him all day. I told her how much the people liked him at Yarmouth,and what a delightful companion he had been. Miss Dartle was full of hints andmysterious questions, but took a great interest in all our proceedings there, andsaid, 'Was it really though?' and so forth, so often, that she got everything out ofme she wanted to know. Her appearance was exactly what I have described it,when I first saw her; but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable, and cameso natural to me, that I felt myself falling a little in love with her. I could not helpthinking, several times in the course of the evening, and particularly when I walkedhome at night, what delightful company she would be in Buckingham Street.\\nI was taking my coffee and roll in the morning, before going to the Commons—\\nand I may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee Mrs. Cruppused, and how weak it was, considering—when Steerforth himself walked in, to myunbounded joy.\\n'My dear Steerforth,' cried I, 'I began to think I should never see you again!''I was carried off, by force of arms,' said Steerforth, 'the very next morning after I\\ngot home.

I therefore made him promise positively in thenames of his two friends, and we appointed six o'clock as the dinner-hour.\\nWhen he was gone, I rang for Mrs. Crupp, and acquainted her with my desperate\\ndesign. Mrs. Crupp said, in the first place, of course it was well known she couldn'tbe expected to wait, but she knew a handy young man,  who she thought could beprevailed upon to do it, and whose terms would be five shillings, and what Ipleased. I said, certainly we would have him. Next Mrs. Crupp said it was clear shecouldn't be in two places at once (which I felt to be reasonable), and that 'a younggal' stationed in the pantry with a bedroom candle, there never to desist fromwashing plates, would be indispensable. I said, what would be the expense of thisyoung female? and Mrs. Crupp said she supposed eighteenpence would neithermake me nor break me. I said I supposed not; and THAT was settled. Then Mrs.Crupp said, Now about the dinner.\\nIt was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger\\nwho had made Mrs. Crupp's kitchen fireplace, that it was capable of cookingnothing but chops and mashed potatoes. As to a fish-kittle, Mrs. Crupp said, well!would I only come and look at the range? She couldn't say fairer than that. Would Icome and look at it? As I should not have been much the wiser if I HAD looked atit, I declined, and said, 'Never mind fish.' But Mrs. Crupp said, Don't say that;oysters was in, why not them? So THAT was settled. Mrs. Crupp then said whatshe would recommend would be this. A pair of hot roast fowls—from the pastry-cook's; a dish of stewed beef, with vegetables—from the pastry-cook's; two littlecorner things, as a raised pie and a dish of kidneys—from the pastrycook's; a tart,and (if I liked) a shape of jelly—from the pastrycook's. This, Mrs. Crupp said,would leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes, and to serveup the cheese and celery as she could wish to see it done.\\nI acted on Mrs. Crupp's opinion, and gave the order at the pastry-cook's myself.\\nWalking along the Strand, afterwards, and observing a hard mottled substance inthe window of a ham and beef shop, which resembled marble, but  was  labelled'Mock Turtle', I went in and bought a slab of it, which I have since seen reason tobelieve would have sufficed for fifteen people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, aftersome difficulty, consented to warm up; and it shrunk so much in a liquid state, thatwe found it what Steerforth called 'rather a tight fit' for four.\"),\n",

They\\nwere both very gay and lively fellows; Grainger, something older than Steerforth;Markham, youthful-looking, and I should say not more than twenty.

A\\nman is hungry all day long. A man is perpetually eating.'\\nBeing a little embarrassed at first, and feeling much too young to  preside, I made\\nSteerforth take the head of the table when dinner was announced, and seated myselfopposite to him. Everything was very good; we did not spare the wine; and  heexerted himself so brilliantly to make the thing pass off well, that there was  nopause in our festivity. I was not quite such good company during dinner as I couldhave wished to be, for my chair was opposite the door, and my attention  wasdistracted by observing that the handy young man went out of the room very often,and that his shadow always presented itself, immediately afterwards, on the wall ofthe entry, with a bottle at its mouth. The 'young gal' likewise occasioned me someuneasiness: not so much by neglecting to wash the plates, as by breaking them. Forbeing of an inquisitive disposition, and unable to confine herself (as her positiveinstructions were) to the pantry, she was constantly peering in at us, and constantlyimagining herself detected; in which belief, she several times retired upon theplates (with which she had carefully paved the floor), and did a great deal  ofdestruction.\\nThese, however, were small drawbacks, and easily forgotten when the  cloth  was\\ncleared, and the dessert put on the table; at which period of the entertainment thehandy young man was discovered to be speechless. Giving him private directionsto seek the society of Mrs. Crupp, and to remove the 'young gal' to the basementalso, I abandoned myself to enjoyment.\\nI began, by being singularly cheerful and light-hearted; all sorts of half-forgotten\\nthings to talk about, came rushing into my mind, and made me hold forth in a mostunwonted manner. I laughed heartily at my own jokes, and everybody else's; calledSteerforth to order for not passing the wine; made several engagements to  go toOxford; announced that I meant to have a dinner-party exactly like that,  once  aweek, until further notice; and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger's box, thatI was obliged to go into the pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing ten minuteslong.\\nI went on, by passing the wine faster and faster yet, and continually starting up with\\na corkscrew to open more wine, long before any was needed.

He said, when he had sung it, he would give us 'Woman!' I took objection tothat, and I couldn't allow it. I said it was not a respectful way of  proposing thetoast, and I would never permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise thanas 'The Ladies!' I was very high with him, mainly I think because I saw Steerforthand Grainger laughing at me—or at him—or at both of us. He said a man was notto be dictated to. I said a man was. He said a man was not to be insulted, then. Isaid he was right there—never under my roof, where the Lares were sacred, andthe laws of hospitality paramount. He said it was no derogation from a man'sdignity to confess that I was a devilish good fellow. I instantly proposed his health.\\nSomebody was smoking. We were all smoking. I was smoking, and trying to\\nsuppress a rising tendency to shudder. Steerforth had made a speech about me, inthe course of which I had been affected almost to tears. I returned thanks, andhoped the present company would dine with me tomorrow, and the day after—eachday at five o'clock, that we might enjoy the pleasures of conversation and societythrough a long evening. I felt called upon to propose an individual. I would givethem my aunt. Miss Betsey Trotwood, the best of her sex!\\nSomebody was leaning out of my bedroom window, refreshing his forehead against\\nthe cool stone of the parapet, and feeling the air upon his face. It was myself. I wasaddressing myself as 'Copperfield', and saying, 'Why did you try to smoke? Youmight have known you couldn't do it.' Now, somebody was unsteadilycontemplating his features in the looking-glass. That was I too. I was very pale inthe looking-glass; my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hair—only my hair,nothing else—looked drunk.\\nSomebody said to me, 'Let us go to the theatre, Copperfield!' There was no\\nbedroom before me, but again the jingling table covered with glasses; the  lamp;Grainger on my right hand, Markham on my left, and Steerforth opposite—allsitting in a mist, and a long way off. The theatre? To be sure. The very  thing.Come along! But they must excuse me if I saw everybody out first, and turned thelamp off—in case of fire.\\nOwing to some confusion in the dark, the door was gone. I was feeling for it in the\\nwindow-curtains, when Steerforth, laughing, took me by the arm and led me out.We went downstairs, one behind another. Near the bottom, somebody fell, androlled down. Somebody else said it was Copperfield. I was angry at that  falsereport, until, finding myself on my back in the passage, I began to think theremight be some foundation for it.\\nA very foggy night, with great rings round the lamps in the streets! There was an\\nindistinct talk of its being wet. I considered it frosty. Steerforth dusted me under alamp-post, and put my hat into shape, which somebody produced from somewherein a most extraordinary manner, for I hadn't had it on before.  Steerforth then said,'You are all right, Copperfield, are you not?' and I told him, 'Neverberrer.'\"),\n",

Shortly afterwards, we were very high up in a very hot theatre, lookingdown into a large pit, that seemed to me to smoke; the people with whom it  wascrammed were so indistinct. There was a great stage, too, looking very clean andsmooth after the streets; and there were people upon it, talking about something orother, but not at all intelligibly.

All it said was, 'My dear Trotwood. I am staying at thehouse of papa's agent, Mr. Waterbrook, in Ely Place, Holborn. Will you come andsee me today, at any time you like to appoint?

It was always earnest; but when it wasvery earnest, as it was now, there was a thrill in it that quite subdued  me.  I  satlooking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work; I sat seeming still to listen toher; and Steerforth, in spite of all my attachment to him, darkened in that tone.\\n'It is very bold in me,' said Agnes, looking up again, 'who have lived in  such\\nseclusion, and can know so little of the world, to give you my advice soconfidently, or even to have this strong opinion.

'What can that be?'Agnes laid aside her work, and replied, folding her hands upon one another, and\\nlooking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers:\\n'I believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa.''What? Uriah? That mean, fawning fellow, worm himself into such promotion!' I\\ncried, indignantly. 'Have you made no remonstrance about it, Agnes? Considerwhat a connexion it is likely to be. You must speak out. You must not allow yourfather to take such a mad step. You must prevent it, Agnes, while there's time.'\\nStill looking at me, Agnes shook her head while I was speaking, with a faint smile\\nat my warmth: and then replied:\\n'You remember our last conversation about papa? It was not long after that—not\\nmore than two or three days—when he gave me the first intimation of what I tellyou.

I felt very sorry.'\\n'Forced upon him, Agnes! Who forces it upon him?''Uriah,' she replied, after a moment's hesitation, 'has made himself indispensable to\\npapa. He is subtle and watchful.

I could not give her pain by asking what it was, for I knewthat she withheld it from me, to spare her father. It had long been going on to this, Iwas sensible: yes, I could not but feel, on the least reflection, that it had been goingon to this for a long time.

Feeling sure that it  was\\nnecessary for papa's peace that the sacrifice should be made, I entreated him  tomake it. I said it would lighten the load of his life—I hope it will!—and  that  itwould give me increased opportunities of being his companion. Oh, Trotwood!'cried Agnes, putting her hands before her face, as her tears started on it,  'I almostfeel as if I had been papa's enemy, instead of his loving child. For I know how hehas altered, in his devotion to me. I know how he has narrowed the circle of hissympathies and duties, in the concentration of his whole mind upon me.  I  knowwhat a multitude of things he has shut out for my sake, and how  his  anxiousthoughts of me have shadowed his life, and weakened his strength and energy, byturning them always upon one idea. If I could ever set this right! If I could everwork out his restoration, as I have so innocently been the cause of his decline!'\\nI had never before seen Agnes cry. I had seen tears in her eyes when I had brought\\nnew honours home from school, and I had seen them there when we  last  spokeabout her father, and I had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leaveof one another; but I had never seen her grieve like this.

Don't, my dearsister!'\\nBut Agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose, as I know well now,\\nwhatever I might know or not know then, to be long in need of my entreaties. Thebeautiful, calm manner, which makes her so different in my remembrance  fromeverybody else, came back again, as if a cloud had passed from a serene sky.\\n'We are not likely to remain alone much longer,' said Agnes, 'and while I have an\\nopportunity, let me earnestly entreat you, Trotwood, to be friendly to Uriah.

It completely conveyed the idea of a manwho had been born, not to say with a silver spoon, but with a scaling-ladder, andhad gone on mounting all the heights of life one after another, until now he looked,from the top of the fortifications, with the eye of a philosopher and a patron, on thepeople down in the trenches.\\nMy reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was announced.\\nMr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet's aunt. Mr. Henry Spiker took Mrs.Waterbrook. Agnes, whom I should have liked to take myself, was given to  asimpering fellow with weak legs.

I was not so vexed at losing Agnes as Imight have been, since it gave me an opportunity of making myself  known  toTraddles on the stairs, who greeted me with great fervour; while Uriah writhed withsuch obtrusive satisfaction and self-abasement, that I could gladly have pitched himover the banisters. Traddles and I were separated at table, being billeted in  tworemote corners: he in the glare of a red velvet lady; I, in the gloom of Hamlet'saunt.

Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us, that if she had a weakness, it wasBlood.\\nIt occurred to me several times that we should have got on better, if we had not\\nbeen quite so genteel. We were so exceedingly genteel, that our scope was verylimited. A Mr. and Mrs. Gulpidge were of the party, who had something to do atsecond-hand (at least, Mr. Gulpidge had) with the law business of the Bank; andwhat with the Bank, and what with the Treasury, we were as exclusive as the CourtCircular. To mend the matter, Hamlet's aunt had the family failing of indulging insoliloquy, and held forth in a desultory manner, by herself, on every topic that wasintroduced.

But these are intangiblepoints. Blood is not so. We see Blood in a nose, and we know it. We meet with itin a chin, and we say, \"There it is! That\\'s Blood!\" It is an actual matter of fact. Wepoint it out. It admits of no doubt.\\'\\nThe simpering fellow with the weak legs, who had taken Agnes down, stated the\\nquestion more decisively yet, I thought.\\n\\'Oh, you know, deuce take it,\\' said this gentleman, looking round the board with an\\nimbecile smile, \\'we can\\'t forego Blood, you know. We must have Blood, you know.Some young fellows, you know, may be a little behind their station,  perhaps,  inpoint of education and behaviour, and may go a little wrong, you know, and getthemselves and other people into a variety of fixes—and all that—but deuce take it,it\\'s delightful to reflect that they\\'ve got Blood in \\'em! Myself, I\\'d rather at any timebe knocked down by a man who had got Blood in him, than I\\'d be picked up by aman who hadn\\'t!\\'\\nThis sentiment, as compressing the general question into a nutshell, gave the\\nutmost satisfaction, and brought the gentleman into great notice until the ladiesretired. After that, I observed that Mr. Gulpidge and Mr. Henry Spiker, who hadhitherto been very distant, entered into a defensive alliance against us, the commonenemy, and exchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat andoverthrow.\\n\\'That affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken\\nthe course that was expected, Spiker,\\' said Mr. Gulpidge.\\n\\'Do you mean the D. of A.\\'s?\\' said Mr. Spiker.\\'The C. of B.\\'s!\\' said Mr. Gulpidge.Mr. Spiker raised his eyebrows, and looked much concerned.\\'When the question was referred to Lord—I needn\\'t name him,\\' said Mr. Gulpidge,\\nchecking himself—\\n\\'I understand,\\' said Mr. Spiker, \\'N.\\'Mr. Gulpidge darkly nodded—\\'was referred to him, his answer was, \"Money, or no\\nrelease.\"\\'\\n\\'Lord bless my soul!\\' cried Mr. Spiker.\"\\'Money, or no release,\"\\' repeated Mr. Gulpidge, firmly. \\'The next in reversion—\\nyou understand me?\\'\\n\\'K.,\\' said Mr. Spiker, with an ominous look.\\'—K. then positively refused to sign.

'Our friend Waterbrook will excuse me if I forbear to explain myselfgenerally, on account of the magnitude of the interests involved.'\\nMr. Waterbrook was only too happy, as it appeared to me, to have such interests,\\nand such names, even hinted at, across his table. He assumed an expression ofgloomy intelligence (though I am persuaded he knew no more about the discussionthan I did), and highly approved of the discretion that had been observed. Mr.Spiker, after the receipt of such a confidence, naturally desired to favour his friendwith a confidence of his own; therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded byanother, in which it was Mr. Gulpidge's turn to be surprised, and that by another  inwhich the surprise came round to Mr. Spiker's turn again, and so on, turn and turnabout. All this time we, the outsiders, remained oppressed by the  tremendousinterests involved in the conversation; and our host regarded us with pride, as thevictims of a salutary awe and astonishment. I was very glad indeed to get upstairsto Agnes, and to talk with her in a corner, and to introduce Traddles to her, whowas shy, but agreeable, and the same good-natured creature still. As he was obligedto leave early, on account of going away next morning for a month, I had notnearly so much conversation with him as I could have wished; but we exchangedaddresses, and promised ourselves the pleasure of another meeting when he shouldcome back to town. He was greatly interested to hear that I knew Steerforth, andspoke of him with such warmth that I made him tell Agnes what he thought of him.But Agnes only looked at me the while, and very slightly shook  her  head  whenonly I observed her.\\nAs she was not among people with whom I believed she could be very much at\\nhome, I was almost glad to hear that she was going away within a few days, thoughI was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again so soon. This caused me toremain until all the company were gone. Conversing with her, and hearing her sing,was such a delightful reminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house shehad made so beautiful, that I could have remained there half the night; but, havingno excuse for staying any longer, when the lights of Mr. Waterbrook's society wereall snuffed out, I took my leave very much against my inclination. I felt then, morethan ever, that she was my better Angel; and if I thought of her  sweet  face  andplacid smile, as though they had shone on me from some removed being, like  anAngel, I hope I thought no harm.\\nI have said that the company were all gone; but I ought to have excepted Uriah,\\nwhom I don't include in that denomination, and who had never ceased to  hovernear us. He was close behind me when I went downstairs. He was close beside me,when I walked away from the house, slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers intothe still longer fingers of a great Guy Fawkes pair of gloves.\\nIt was in no disposition for Uriah's company, but in remembrance of the entreaty\\nAgnes had made to me, that I asked him if he would come home to my rooms, andhave some coffee.\\n'Oh, really, Master Copperfield,' he rejoined—'I beg your pardon, Mister\\nCopperfield, but the other comes so natural, I don't like that you should put  aconstraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like me to your ouse.'\\n'There is no constraint in the case,' said I.

I  was  at  the\\ncoach office to take leave of her and see her go; and there was  he,  returning  to\\nCanterbury by the same conveyance. It was some small satisfaction to me toobserve his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered, mulberry-coloured great -coatperched up, in company with an umbrella like a small tent, on the edge of the backseat on the roof, while Agnes was, of course, inside; but what I underwent in myefforts to be friendly with him, while Agnes looked on, perhaps deserved that littlerecompense. At the coach window, as at the dinner-party, he hovered about uswithout a moment's intermission, like a great vulture: gorging himself on everysyllable that I said to Agnes, or Agnes said to me.\\nIn the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown me, I had\\nthought very much of the words Agnes had used in reference to the partnership. 'Idid what I hope was right. Feeling sure that it was necessary for papa's peace thatthe sacrifice should be made, I entreated him to make it.' A miserable forebodingthat she would yield to, and sustain herself by, the same feeling in reference to anysacrifice for his sake, had oppressed me ever since. I knew how she loved him. Iknew what the devotion of her nature was. I knew from her own lips that sheregarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors, and as owing him a great debtshe ardently desired to pay. I had no consolation in seeing how different she wasfrom this detestable Rufus with the mulberry-coloured great-coat, for I felt that  inthe very difference between them, in the self-denial of her pure soul and the sordidbaseness of his, the greatest danger lay. All this, doubtless, he knew thoroughly,and had, in his cunning, considered well.\\nYet I was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off, must destroy the\\nhappiness of Agnes; and I was so sure, from her manner, of its being unseen by herthen, and having cast no shadow on her yet; that I could as soon have injured her,as given her any warning of what impended. Thus it was that we parted withoutexplanation: she waving her hand and smiling farewell from the  coach  window;her evil genius writhing on the roof, as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed.\\nI could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time. When Agnes\\nwrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when I saw her goingaway. Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this subject was sure to present itself,and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled. Hardly a night passed without mydreaming of it. It became a part of my life, and as inseparable from my life as myown head.\\nI had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness: for Steerforth was at Oxford, as\\nhe wrote to me, and when I was not at the Commons, I was very much alone. Ibelieve I had at this time some lurking distrust of Steerforth. I wrote to him mostaffectionately in reply to his, but I think I was glad, upon the whole, that he couldnot come to London just then. I suspect the truth to be, that the influence of Agneswas upon me, undisturbed by the sight of him; and that it was the more powerfulwith me, because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest.\\nIn the meantime, days and weeks slipped away. I was articled to Spenlow and\\nJorkins. I had ninety pounds a year (exclusive of my house-rent and sundrycollateral matters) from my aunt. My rooms were engaged for twelve monthscertain: and though I still found them dreary of an evening, and the evenings long,I could settle down into a state of equable low spirits, and resign myself to coffee;which I seem, on looking back, to have taken by the gallon at about this period ofmy existence. At about this time, too, I made three discoveries: first, that Mrs.Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called 'the spazzums', which was\"),\n",

I went to see The Stranger, as a Doctors' Commons sort of play, and wasso dreadfully cut up, that I hardly knew myself in my own glass when I got home.Mr. Spenlow remarked, on this occasion, when we concluded our business, that heshould have been happy to have seen me at his house at Norwood to celebrate ourbecoming connected, but for his domestic arrangements being in some disorder, onaccount of the expected return of his daughter from finishing her education at Paris.But, he intimated that when she came home he should hope to have the pleasure ofentertaining me. I knew that he was a widower with one daughter, and expressedmy acknowledgements.\\nMr. Spenlow was as good as his word. In a week or two, he referred to  this\\nengagement, and said, that if I would do him the favour to come down nextSaturday, and stay till Monday, he would be extremely happy. Of course I said Iwould do him the favour; and he was to drive me down in his phaeton, and to bringme back.\\nWhen the day arrived, my very carpet-bag was an object of veneration to  the\\nstipendiary clerks, to whom the house at Norwood was a sacred mystery. One ofthem informed me that he had heard that Mr. Spenlow ate entirely  off  plate  andchina; and another hinted at champagne being constantly on draught, after the usualcustom of table-beer. The old clerk with the wig, whose name was Mr. Tiffey, hadbeen down on business several times in the course of his career, and had on eachoccasion penetrated to the breakfast-parlour. He described it as an apartment of themost sumptuous nature, and said that he had drunk brown East India sherry there,of a quality so precious as to make a man wink. We had an adjourned cause in theConsistory that day—about excommunicating a baker who had been objecting in avestry to a paving-rate—and as the evidence was just twice the length of RobinsonCrusoe, according to a calculation I made, it was rather late in the day before wefinished. However, we got him excommunicated for six weeks, and sentenced in noend of costs; and then the baker's proctor, and the judge, and the advocates on bothsides (who were all nearly related), went out of town together, and Mr. Spenlowand I drove away in the phaeton.\\nThe phaeton was a very handsome affair; the horses arched their necks and lifted\\nup their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors' Commons. There  was  agood deal of competition in the Commons on all points of display, and it turned outsome very choice equipages then; though I always have considered, and alwaysshall consider, that in my time the great article of competition there was  starch:which I think was worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it  is  in  thenature of man to bear.\\nWe were very pleasant, going down, and Mr. Spenlow gave me some hints in\\nreference to my profession. He said it was the genteelest profession in the world,and must on no account be confounded with the profession of a  solicitor:  beingquite another sort of thing, infinitely more exclusive, less mechanical, and moreprofitable. We took things much more easily in the Commons than they could betaken anywhere else, he observed, and that set us, as a privileged class, apart. He\"),\n",

He\\nreplied, that a good case of a disputed will, where there was a neat little estate ofthirty or forty thousand pounds, was, perhaps, the best of all. In such a case, hesaid, not only were there very pretty pickings, in the way of arguments at everystage of the proceedings, and mountains upon mountains of evidence oninterrogatory and counter-interrogatory (to say nothing of an appeal lying, first tothe Delegates, and then to the Lords), but, the costs being  pretty sure to come outof the estate at last, both sides went at it in a lively and spirited  manner,  andexpense was no consideration. Then, he launched into a general eulogium on theCommons. What was to be particularly admired (he said) in the Commons, was itscompactness. It was the most conveniently organized place in the world. It was thecomplete idea of snugness. It lay in a nutshell. For example: You brought a divorcecase, or a restitution case, into the Consistory. Very good. You tried it in theConsistory. You made a quiet little round game of it, among a family group, andyou played it out at leisure. Suppose you were not satisfied with the Consistory,what did you do then? Why, you went into the Arches. What was the Arches? Thesame court, in the same room, with the same bar, and the same practitioners, butanother judge, for there the Consistory judge could plead any court-day as anadvocate. Well, you played your round game out again. Still you were not satisfied.Very good. What did you do then? Why, you went to the Delegates. Who were theDelegates? Why, the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without anybusiness, who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in both courts,and had seen the cards shuffled, and cut, and played, and had talked to all  theplayers about it, and now came fresh, as judges, to settle the matter to thesatisfaction of everybody! Discontented people might talk of corruption in theCommons, closeness in the Commons, and the necessity of reforming theCommons, said Mr. Spenlow solemnly, in conclusion; but when the price of wheatper bushel had been highest, the Commons had been busiest; and a man might layhis hand upon his heart, and say this to the whole world,—'Touch the Commons,and down comes the country!'\\nI listened to all this with attention; and though, I must say, I had my doubts\\nwhether the country was quite as much obliged to the Commons as Mr. Spenlowmade out, I respectfully deferred to his opinion. That about the price of wheat perbushel, I modestly felt was too much for my strength, and quite settled thequestion. I have never, to this hour, got the better of that bushel of wheat. It hasreappeared to annihilate me, all through my life, in connexion with all kinds  ofsubjects. I don't know now, exactly, what it has to do with me, or what right it hasto crush me, on an infinite variety of occasions; but whenever I see my old friendthe bushel brought in by the head and shoulders (as he always is, I observe), I giveup a subject for lost.\\nThis is a digression. I was not the man to touch the Commons, and bring down the\\ncountry. I submissively expressed, by my silence, my acquiescence in all I hadheard from my superior in years and knowledge; and we talked about The Strangerand the Drama, and the pairs of horses, until we came to Mr. Spenlow's gate.\\nThere was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow's house; and though that was not the\\nbest time of the year for seeing a garden, it was so beautifully kept, that I was quiteenchanted.

'Dear me!'\\nWe went into the house, which was cheerfully lighted up, and into  a  hall  where\\nthere were all sorts of hats, caps, great-coats, plaids, gloves, whips, and walking-sticks. 'Where is Miss Dora?' said Mr. Spenlow to the servant. 'Dora!' I thought.'What a beautiful name!'\\nWe turned into a room near at hand (I think it was the identical breakfast-room,\\nmade memorable by the brown East Indian sherry), and I heard a voice say, 'Mr.Copperfield, my daughter Dora, and my daughter Dora's confidential friend!'  Itwas, no doubt, Mr. Spenlow's voice, but I didn't know it, and I didn't care whose itwas. All was over in a moment. I had fulfilled my destiny. I was a captive and aslave. I loved Dora Spenlow to distraction!\\nShe was more than human to me. She was a Fairy, a Sylph, I don't know what she\\nwas—anything that no one ever saw, and everything that everybody ever wanted. Iwas swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant. There was no pausing  on thebrink; no looking down, or looking back; I was gone, headlong, before I had senseto say a word to her.\\n'I,' observed a well-remembered voice, when I had bowed and murmured\\nsomething, 'have seen Mr. Copperfield before.'\\nThe speaker was not Dora. No; the confidential friend, Miss Murdstone!I don't think I was much astonished. To the best of my judgement, no capacity  of\\nastonishment was left in me. There was nothing worth mentioning in the materialworld, but Dora Spenlow, to be astonished about. I said, 'How do you do, MissMurdstone? I hope you are well.' She answered, 'Very well.' I said, 'How is Mr.Murdstone?' She replied, 'My brother is robust, I am obliged to you.'\\nMr. Spenlow, who, I suppose, had been surprised to see us recognize each other,\\nthen put in his word.\\n'I am glad to find,' he said, 'Copperfield, that you and Miss Murdstone are already\\nacquainted.'\\n'Mr. Copperfield and myself,' said Miss Murdstone, with severe composure,  'are\\nconnexions. We were once slightly acquainted. It was in his childish days.Circumstances have separated us since. I should not have known him.'\\nI replied that I should have known her, anywhere. Which was true enough.'Miss Murdstone has had the goodness,' said Mr. Spenlow to me, 'to accept  the\\noffice—if I may so describe it—of my daughter Dora's confidential friend. Mydaughter Dora having, unhappily, no mother, Miss Murdstone is obliging enough tobecome her companion and protector.'\\nA passing thought occurred to me that Miss Murdstone, like the pocket instrument\\ncalled a life-preserver, was not so much designed for purposes of protection as ofassault. But as I had none but passing thoughts for any subject save Dora, I glancedat her, directly afterwards, and was thinking that I saw, in her prettily pettishmanner, that she was not very much inclined to be particularly confidential to hercompanion and protector, when a bell rang, which Mr. Spenlow said  was the firstdinner-bell, and so carried me off to dress.\\nThe idea of dressing one's self, or doing anything in the way of action, in that state\"),\n",

There was some company. Dora was talking to an old gentleman with agrey head. Grey as he was—and a great-grandfather into the bargain, for he said so—I was madly jealous of him.\\nWhat a state of mind I was in! I was jealous of everybody. I couldn't bear the idea\\nof anybody knowing Mr. Spenlow better than I did. It was torturing  to me to hearthem talk of occurrences in which I had had no share.

I have not the least idea what we\\nhad for dinner, besides Dora. My impression is, that I dined off Dora, entirely, andsent away half-a-dozen plates untouched. I sat next to her. I talked to her. She hadthe most delightful little voice, the gayest little laugh, the pleasantest and mostfascinating little ways, that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery. She wasrather diminutive altogether. So much the more precious, I thought.\\nWhen she went out of the room with Miss Murdstone (no other ladies were of the\\nparty), I fell into a reverie, only disturbed by the cruel apprehension that MissMurdstone would disparage me to her. The amiable creature with the polished headtold me a long story, which I think was about gardening. I think I heard him say,'my gardener', several times. I seemed to pay the deepest attention to him, but I waswandering in a garden of Eden all the while, with Dora.\\nMy apprehensions of being disparaged to the object of my engrossing affection\\nwere revived when we went into the drawing-room, by the grim and distant aspectof Miss Murdstone.

'Far from it, ma'am,' I returned.\\n'Far from it,' assented Miss Murdstone. 'I do not wish to revive the memory of past\\ndifferences, or of past outrages. I have received outrages from a person—a femaleI am sorry to say, for the credit of my sex—who is not to be mentioned withoutscorn and disgust; and therefore I would rather not mention her.'\\nI felt very fiery on my aunt's account; but I said it would certainly be better, if Miss\\nMurdstone pleased, not to mention her. I could not hear her disrespectfullymentioned, I added, without expressing my opinion in a decided tone.\\nMiss Murdstone shut her eyes, and disdainfully inclined her head; then, slowly\\nopening her eyes, resumed:\\n'David Copperfield, I shall not attempt to disguise the fact, that I formed  an\\nunfavourable opinion of you in your childhood.

That I was lost in blissful delirium. ThatI refused refreshment. That my soul recoiled from punch particularly. That whenMiss Murdstone took her into custody and led her away, she smiled and gave meher delicious hand. That I caught a view of myself in a mirror, looking perfectlyimbecile and idiotic.

I walked about, wondering what my feelings of\\nhappiness would be, if I could ever become engaged to this dear wonder.  As  tomarriage, and fortune, and all that, I believe I was almost as innocentlyundesigning then, as when I loved little Em'ly. To be allowed to call her 'Dora', towrite to her, to dote upon and worship her, to have reason to think that  when shewas with other people she was yet mindful of me, seemed to me  the  summit  ofhuman ambition—I am sure it was the summit of mine.

It was in the state of my own feelings, I added bashfully: to clench theexplanation.\\nI never saw such curls—how could I, for there never were such curls!—as those\\nshe shook out to hide her blushes.

'Have you ever been there?''No.''Oh! I hope you'll go soon! You would like it so much!'Traces of deep-seated anguish appeared in my countenance. That she should hope I\\nwould go, that she should think it possible I could go, was insupportable. Idepreciated Paris; I depreciated France. I said I wouldn't leave England, underexisting circumstances, for any earthly consideration. Nothing should induce me.

Within the first week of my passion, I bought four  sumptuouswaistcoats—not for myself; I had no pride in them; for Dora—and took to wearingstraw-coloured kid gloves in the streets, and laid the foundations of all the corns Ihave ever had. If the boots I wore at that period could only be produced  andcompared with the natural size of my feet, they would show what the state of myheart was, in a most affecting manner.\\nAnd yet, wretched cripple as I made myself by this act of homage to Dora,  I\\nwalked miles upon miles daily in the hope of seeing her.

Sometimes, at long intervals and on rareoccasions, I saw her. Perhaps I saw her glove waved in a carriage window; perhapsI met her, walked with her and Miss Murdstone a little way, and spoke to her. Inthe latter case I was always very miserable afterwards, to think that I had saidnothing to the purpose; or that she had no idea of the extent of my devotion, or thatshe cared nothing about me.

TOMMY TRADDLES\\nIt may have been in consequence of Mrs. Crupp's advice, and, perhaps, for nobetter reason than because there was a certain similarity in the sound of the wordskittles and Traddles, that it came into my head, next day, to go and look  afterTraddles. The time he had mentioned was more than out, and he lived in a littlestreet near the Veterinary College at Camden Town, which was principallytenanted, as one of our clerks who lived in that direction informed me,  bygentlemen students, who bought live donkeys, and made experiments on thosequadrupeds in their private apartments. Having obtained from this clerk a directionto the academic grove in question, I set out, the same afternoon, to visit my oldschoolfellow.\\nI found that the street was not as desirable a one as I could have wished it to be, for\\nthe sake of Traddles. The inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw anylittle trifles they were not in want of, into the road: which not only made it rankand sloppy, but untidy too, on account of the cabbage-leaves. The refuse was notwholly vegetable either, for I myself saw a shoe, a doubled-up saucepan, a blackbonnet, and an umbrella, in various stages of decomposition, as I was looking outfor the number I wanted.\\nThe general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when I lived with\\nMr. and Mrs. Micawber. An indescribable character of faded gentility that attachedto the house I sought, and made it unlike all the other houses in the street—thoughthey were all built on one monotonous pattern, and looked like the early copies of ablundering boy who was learning to make houses, and had not yet got out of hiscramped brick-and-mortar pothooks—reminded me still more of Mr. and Mrs.Micawber.

'Has that there little bill of\\nmine been heerd on?'\\n'Oh, master says he'll attend to it immediate,' was the reply.'Because,' said the milkman, going on as if he had received no answer, and\\nspeaking, as I judged from his tone, rather for the edification of somebody withinthe house, than of the youthful servant—an impression which was strengthened byhis manner of glaring down the passage—'because that there little bill has beenrunning so long, that I begin to believe it's run away altogether, and never won't beheerd of. Now, I'm not a going to stand it, you know!' said the  milkman,  stillthrowing his voice into the house, and glaring down the passage.\\nAs to his dealing in the mild article of milk, by the by, there never was a greater\\nanomaly. His deportment would have been fierce in a butcher or a brandy-merchant.\"),\n",

'Good,' said the milkman. 'Then you won't  have none\\ntomorrow. D'ye hear? Not a fragment of milk you won't have tomorrow.'\\nI thought she seemed, upon the whole, relieved by the prospect of having  any\\ntoday. The milkman, after shaking his head at her darkly, released  her  chin,  andwith anything rather than good-will opened his can, and deposited the usualquantity in the family jug. This done, he went away, muttering, and uttered the cryof his trade next door, in a vindictive shriek.\\n'Does Mr. Traddles live here?' I then inquired.A mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied 'Yes.' Upon which the\\nyouthful servant replied 'Yes.'\\n'Is he at home?' said I.Again the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative, and again the servant echoed\\nit. Upon this, I walked in, and in pursuance of the servant's directions  walkedupstairs; conscious, as I passed the back parlour-door, that I was surveyed  by amysterious eye, probably belonging to the mysterious voice.\\nWhen I got to the top of the stairs—the house was only a story high  above  the\\nground floor—Traddles was on the landing to meet me. He was delighted to seeme, and gave me welcome, with great heartiness, to his little room. It was in thefront of the house, and extremely neat, though sparely furnished. It was his onlyroom, I saw; for there was a sofa-bedstead in it, and his  blacking -brushes andblacking were among his books—on the top shelf, behind a dictionary. His tablewas covered with papers, and he was hard at work in an old coat. I looked atnothing, that I know of, but I saw everything, even to the prospect of a church uponhis china inkstand, as I sat down—and this, too, was a faculty confirmed in me inthe old Micawber times. Various ingenious arrangements he had made, for  thedisguise of his chest of drawers, and the accommodation of his boots, his shaving-glass, and so forth, particularly impressed themselves upon me, as evidences of thesame Traddles who used to make models of elephants' dens in writing-paper to putflies in; and to comfort himself under ill usage, with the memorable works of art Ihave so often mentioned.\\nIn a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large white cloth. I\\ncould not make out what that was.\\n'Traddles,' said I, shaking hands with him again, after I had sat down, 'I  am\\ndelighted to see you.'\\n'I am delighted to see YOU, Copperfield,' he returned. 'I am very glad indeed to see\\nyou. It was because I was thoroughly glad to see you when we met  in Ely Place,and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see me, that I gave you this  addressinstead of my address at chambers.' 'Oh! You have chambers?' said I.\\n'Why, I have the fourth of a room and a passage, and the fourth of a clerk,'\\nreturned Traddles. 'Three others and myself unite to have a set  of  chambers—tolook business-like—and we quarter the clerk too. Half-a-crown a week  he  costs\"),\n",

It's only on account of those who come tome, who might not like to come here. For myself, I am fighting my way on in theworld against difficulties, and it would be ridiculous if I made a pretence of doinganything else.'\\n'You are reading for the bar, Mr. Waterbrook informed me?' said I.'Why, yes,' said Traddles, rubbing his hands slowly over one another. 'I am reading\\nfor the bar. The fact is, I have just begun to keep my terms,  after  rather  a  longdelay. It's some time since I was articled, but the payment of that  hundred poundswas a great pull. A great pull!' said Traddles, with a wince, as if he had had a toothout.\\n'Do you know what I can't help thinking of, Traddles, as I sit here looking at you?'\\nI asked him.\\n'No,' said he.'That sky-blue suit you used to wear.''Lord, to be sure!' cried Traddles, laughing. 'Tight in the arms and legs, you know?\\nDear me! Well! Those were happy times, weren't they?'\\n'I think our schoolmaster might have made them happier, without doing any harm\\nto any of us, I acknowledge,' I returned.\\n'Perhaps he might,' said Traddles.

He was a retired—what do you call it!—draper—cloth -merchant—and had\\nmade me his heir. But he didn't like me when I grew up.'\\n'Do you really mean that?' said I.

For I am a plodding kind of fellow,Copperfield, and had learnt the way of doing such things pithily. Well! That put itin my head to enter myself as a law student; and that ran away with all that was leftof the fifty pounds. Yawler recommended me to one or two other offices, however—Mr. Waterbrook's for one—and I got a good many jobs. I was fortunate enough,too, to become acquainted with a person in the publishing way, who was getting upan Encyclopaedia, and he set me to work; and, indeed' (glancing at his table), 'I amat work for him at this minute. I am not a bad compiler, Copperfield,' saidTraddles, preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all  he said, 'but I haveno invention at all; not a particle. I suppose there never was a young man with lessoriginality than I have.'\\nAs Traddles seemed to expect that I should assent to this as a matter of course, I\\nnodded; and he went on, with the same sprightly patience—I can find no betterexpression—as before.\\n'So, by little and little, and not living high, I managed to scrape  up the  hundred\\npounds at last,' said Traddles; 'and thank Heaven that's paid—though it was—though it certainly was,' said Traddles, wincing again as if he had had another toothout, 'a pull.

The quantity of\\nwalking exercise I took, was not in this respect attended with its usualconsequence, as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air. I have my doubts,too, founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life, whether asound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in any human  subjectwho is always in torment from tight boots. I think the extremities require to be atpeace before the stomach will conduct itself with vigour.\\nOn the occasion of this domestic little party, I did not repeat my former extensive\\npreparations. I merely provided a pair of soles, a small leg of mutton, and apigeon-pie. Mrs. Crupp broke out into rebellion on my first bashful hint inreference to the cooking of the fish and joint, and said, with a dignified sense ofinjury, 'No! No, sir! You will not ask me sich a thing, for you are better acquaintedwith me than to suppose me capable of doing what I cannot do with ampialsatisfaction to my own feelings!' But, in the end, a compromise was effected; andMrs. Crupp consented to achieve this feat, on condition that I dined from home fora fortnight afterwards.\\nAnd here I may remark, that what I underwent from Mrs. Crupp, in consequence of\\nthe tyranny she established over me, was dreadful. I never was so much afraid ofanyone. We made a compromise of everything. If I hesitated, she was taken withthat wonderful disorder which was always lying in ambush in her system, ready, atthe shortest notice, to prey upon her vitals. If I rang the bell impatiently, after half-a-dozen unavailing modest pulls, and she appeared at last—which was not by anymeans to be relied upon—she would appear with a reproachful aspect, sinkbreathless on a chair near the door, lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom,  andbecome so ill, that I was glad, at any sacrifice of brandy or anything else, to get ridof her. If I objected to having my bed made at five o'clock in the afternoon—whichI do still think an uncomfortable arrangement—one motion of her hand towards thesame nankeen region of wounded sensibility was enough to make me falter  anapology. In short, I would have done anything in an honourable way rather thangive Mrs. Crupp offence; and she was the terror of my life.\\nI bought a second-hand dumb-waiter for this dinner-party, in preference to  re -\\nengaging the handy young man; against whom I had conceived a prejudice,  inconsequence of meeting him in the Strand, one Sunday morning, in a  waistcoatremarkably like one of mine, which had been missing since the former occasion.The 'young gal' was re-engaged; but on the stipulation that she should only bring inthe dishes, and then withdraw to the landing-place, beyond the outer door; where ahabit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests, and  where herretiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility.\\nHaving laid in the materials for a bowl of punch, to be compounded by Mr.\\nMicawber; having provided a bottle of lavender-water, two wax-candles, a paper ofmixed pins, and a pincushion, to assist Mrs. Micawber in her toilette at mydressing-table; having also caused the fire in my bedroom to be lighted for Mrs.Micawber's convenience; and having laid the cloth with my own hands, I awaitedthe result with composure.\\nAt the appointed time, my three visitors arrived together. Mr. Micawber with more\\nshirt-collar than usual, and a new ribbon to his eye-glass; Mrs. Micawber with hercap in a whitey-brown paper parcel; Traddles carrying the parcel, and supportingMrs. Micawber on his arm.

'He\\ncannot answer for others.'\\n'My dear,' returned Mr. Micawber with sudden seriousness, 'I have no desire to\\nanswer for others. I am too well aware that when, in the inscrutable decrees  ofFate, you were reserved for me, it is possible you may have been reserved for one,destined, after a protracted struggle, at length to fall a victim to pecuniaryinvolvements of a complicated nature. I understand your allusion, my love. I regretit, but I can bear it.'\\n'Micawber!' exclaimed Mrs. Micawber, in tears. 'Have I deserved this! I, who never\\nhave deserted you; who never WILL desert you, Micawber!' 'My love,'  said  Mr.Micawber, much affected, 'you will forgive, and our old and tried friendCopperfield will, I am sure, forgive, the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit,made sensitive by a recent collision with the Minion of Power—in  other  words,with a ribald Turncock attached to the water-works—and will pity, not condemn,its excesses.'\\nMr. Micawber then embraced Mrs. Micawber, and pressed my hand; leaving me to\\ninfer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water had been cut offthat afternoon, in consequence of default in the payment of the company's rates.\\nTo divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject, I informed Mr. Micawber that\\nI relied upon him for a bowl of punch, and led him to the lemons. His recentdespondency, not to say despair, was gone in a moment. I never saw a  man  sothoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance of lemon-peel and sugar, the odour ofburning rum, and the steam of boiling water, as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon. Itwas wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicatefumes, as he stirred, and mixed, and tasted, and looked as if he were making,instead of punch, a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity.  As to Mrs.Micawber, I don't know whether it was the effect of the cap, or the lavender-water,or the pins, or the fire, or the wax-candles, but she came out of my room,comparatively speaking, lovely. And the lark was never gayer than that excellentwoman.\\nI suppose—I never ventured to inquire, but I suppose—that Mrs. Crupp, after\\nfrying the soles, was taken ill. Because we broke down at that point.  The  leg  ofmutton came up very red within, and very pale without: besides having a foreignsubstance of a gritty nature sprinkled over it, as if if had had a fall into the ashes ofthat remarkable kitchen fireplace. But we were not in condition to judge of this factfrom the appearance of the gravy, forasmuch as the 'young gal' had dropped it allupon the stairs—where it remained, by the by, in a long train, until it was worn out.The pigeon-pie was not bad, but it was a delusive pie: the crust being like adisappointing head, phrenologically speaking: full of lumps and bumps, withnothing particular underneath. In short, the banquet was such a failure that I shouldhave been quite unhappy—about the failure, I mean, for I was always unhappyabout Dora—if I had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company,and by a bright suggestion from Mr. Micawber.\"),\n",

We had it in, in a twinkling, and immediately applied ourselves to carryingMr. Micawber's idea into effect. The division of labour to which he had referredwas this:—Traddles cut the mutton into slices; Mr. Micawber (who could doanything of this sort to perfection) covered them with pepper, mustard,  salt,  andcayenne; I put them on the gridiron, turned them with a fork, and took them  off,under Mr. Micawber's direction; and Mrs. Micawber heated, and continually stirred,some mushroom ketchup in a little saucepan. When we had slices enough done tobegin upon, we fell-to, with our sleeves still tucked up at the wrist, more  slicessputtering and blazing on the fire, and our attention divided between the mutton onour plates, and the mutton then preparing.\\nWhat with the novelty of this cookery, the excellence of it, the bustle of  it,  the\\nfrequent starting up to look after it, the frequent sitting down to dispose of it as thecrisp slices came off the gridiron hot and hot, the being so busy, so flushed withthe fire, so amused, and in the midst of such a tempting noise and savour, wereduced the leg of mutton to the bone. My own appetite came back miraculously. Iam ashamed to record it, but I really believe I forgot Dora for a little while.

As for me, I was a mere infant at the head of my own table; and hardlyventured to glance at the respectable phenomenon, who had come from Heavenknows where, to put my establishment to rights.\\nMeanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron, and gravely handed it round. We all\\ntook some, but our appreciation of it was gone, and we merely made a show ofeating it. As we severally pushed away our plates, he noiselessly removed them,and set on the cheese. He took that off, too, when it was  done  with;  cleared  thetable; piled everything on the dumb-waiter; gave us our wine-glasses; and, of hisown accord, wheeled the dumb-waiter into the pantry.

My visitors seemed to breathe more freelywhen he was gone; but my own relief was very great, for besides the constraint,arising from that extraordinary sense of being at a disadvantage which I always hadin this man's presence, my conscience had embarrassed me with whispers that I hadmistrusted his master, and I could not repress a vague uneasy dread that  he mightfind it out. How was it, having so little in reality to conceal, that I always DID feelas if this man were finding me out?\\nMr. Micawber roused me from this reflection, which was blended with a certain\\nremorseful apprehension of seeing Steerforth himself, by bestowing manyencomiums on the absent Littimer as a most respectable fellow, and a thoroughlyadmirable servant.

Traddles, who took his tonefrom me, did likewise, still looking at the fire.\\n\\'I will not,\\' said Mrs. Micawber, finishing her punch, and gathering her scarf about\\nher shoulders, preparatory to her withdrawal to my bedroom: \\'I will  not  protractthese remarks on the subject of Mr. Micawber\\'s pecuniary affairs.

I feel that the time isarrived when Mr. Micawber should exert himself and—I will add—assert himself,and it appears to me that these are the means. I am aware that I am merely afemale, and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent tothe discussion of such questions; still I must not forget that, when I lived at homewith my papa and mama, my papa was in the habit of saying,  \"Emma\\'s  form  isfragile, but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none.\" That my papa was too partial,I well know; but that he was an observer of character in some degree, my duty andmy reason equally forbid me to doubt.\\'\\nWith these words, and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the remaining\\ncirculation of the punch with her presence, Mrs. Micawber retired to my bedroom.And really I felt that she was a noble woman—the sort of woman who might havebeen a Roman matron, and done all manner of heroic things, in times  of  publictrouble.\\nIn the fervour of this impression, I congratulated Mr. Micawber on the treasure he\\npossessed. So did Traddles. Mr. Micawber extended his hand to each of us  insuccession, and then covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief, which I thinkhad more snuff upon it than he was aware of. He then returned to the punch, in thehighest state of exhilaration.\\nHe was full of eloquence. He gave us to understand that in our children we lived\\nagain, and that, under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties, any accession to theirnumber was doubly welcome. He said that Mrs. Micawber had latterly had herdoubts on this point, but that he had dispelled them, and reassured her. As to herfamily, they were totally unworthy of her, and their sentiments were utterlyindifferent to him, and they might—I quote his own expression—go to the Devil.\\nMr. Micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on Traddles. He said Traddles\\'s was a\\ncharacter, to the steady virtues of which he (Mr. Micawber) could lay no claim, butwhich, he thanked Heaven, he could admire. He feelingly alluded to the younglady, unknown, whom Traddles had honoured with his affection, and who hadreciprocated that affection by honouring and blessing Traddles with her affection.Mr. Micawber pledged her.

He mentioned a terrace at the western end ofOxford Street, fronting Hyde Park, on which he had always had his eye, but whichhe did not expect to attain immediately, as it would require a large establishment.There would probably be an interval, he explained, in which he should contenthimself with the upper part of a house, over some respectable place of business—say in Piccadilly,—which would be a cheerful situation for Mrs.  Micawber;  andwhere, by throwing out a bow-window, or carrying up the roof another story, ormaking some little alteration of that sort, they might live, comfortably andreputably, for a few years. Whatever was reserved for him, he expressly said, orwherever his abode might be, we might rely on this—there would always be aroom for Traddles, and a knife and fork for me. We acknowledged his kindness;and he begged us to forgive his having launched into these practical and business-like details, and to excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely newarrangements in life.\\nMrs. Micawber, tapping at the wall again to know if tea were ready, broke up this\\nparticular phase of our friendly conversation. She made tea for us in a  mostagreeable manner; and, whenever I went near her, in handing about the tea-cupsand bread-and-butter, asked me, in a whisper, whether D. was fair, or dark, orwhether she was short, or tall: or something of that kind; which I think  I  liked.After tea, we discussed a variety of topics before the fire; and Mrs. Micawber wasgood enough to sing us (in a small, thin, flat voice, which I remembered to haveconsidered, when I first knew her, the very table-beer of acoustics) the favouriteballads of 'The Dashing White Sergeant', and 'Little Tafflin'. For both of  thesesongs Mrs. Micawber had been famous when she lived at home with her papa andmama. Mr. Micawber told us, that when he heard her sing the first one, on the firstoccasion of his seeing her beneath the parental roof, she had attracted his attentionin an extraordinary degree; but that when it came to Little Tafflin, he had resolvedto win that woman or perish in the attempt.\\nIt was between ten and eleven o'clock when Mrs. Micawber rose to replace her cap\\nin the whitey-brown paper parcel, and to put on her bonnet. Mr. Micawber took theopportunity of Traddles putting on his great-coat, to slip a letter into my hand, witha whispered request that I would read it at my leisure.

I  took  thatopportunity, with my voice sticking in my throat, and my sight failing as I utteredthe words, to express my hope that Miss Spenlow was quite well; to  which  Mr.Spenlow replied, with no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinaryhuman being, that he was much obliged to me, and she was very well.\\nWe articled clerks, as germs of the patrician order of proctors, were treated with so\\nmuch consideration, that I was almost my own master at all times.

It arose out of a scuffle between two churchwardens, one of whom wasalleged to have pushed the other against a pump; the handle of which pumpprojecting into a school-house, which school-house was under a gable of thechurch-roof, made the push an ecclesiastical offence.

I was agreeably\\nsurprised to find that Littimer was not there, and that we were attended by a modestlittle parlour-maid, with blue ribbons in her cap, whose eye it was much morepleasant, and much less disconcerting, to catch by accident, than the eye  of  thatrespectable man. But what I particularly observed, before I had been half-an-hourin the house, was the close and attentive watch Miss Dartle kept upon me;  and thelurking manner in which she seemed to compare my face with Steerforth's,  andSteerforth's with mine, and to lie in wait for something to come out between thetwo. So surely as I looked towards her, did I see that eager visage, with its gauntblack eyes and searching brow, intent on mine; or passing suddenly from mine  toSteerforth's; or comprehending both of us at once. In this lynx -like scrutiny  shewas so far from faltering when she saw I observed it, that at such a time she onlyfixed her piercing look upon me with a more intent expression still. Blameless as Iwas, and knew that I was, in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect meof, I shrunk before her strange eyes, quite unable to endure their hungry lustre.\\nAll day, she seemed to pervade the whole house. If I talked to  Steerforth  in  his\\nroom, I heard her dress rustle in the little gallery outside. When he and I engagedin some of our old exercises on the lawn behind the house, I saw  her  face  passfrom window to window, like a wandering light, until it fixed itself in  one,  andwatched us. When we all four went out walking in the afternoon, she closed herthin hand on my arm like a spring, to keep me back, while Steerforth  and  hismother went on out of hearing: and then spoke to me.\\n'You have been a long time,' she said, 'without coming here. Is your  profession\\nreally so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention? I ask becauseI always want to be informed, when I am ignorant. Is it really, though?'\\nI replied that I liked it well enough, but that I certainly could not claim so much for\\nit.\\n'Oh! I am glad to know that, because I always like to be put right when I am\\nwrong,' said Rosa Dartle. 'You mean it is a little dry, perhaps?'\\n'Well,' I replied; 'perhaps it was a little dry.''Oh! and that's a reason why you want relief and change—excitement and all that?'\\nsaid she. 'Ah! very true! But isn't it a little—Eh?—for him; I don't mean you?'\\nA quick glance of her eye towards the spot where Steerforth was walking, with his\\nmother leaning on his arm, showed me whom she meant; but beyond that, I wasquite lost.

Don't it make him, perhaps, a little more remiss than usual in his visits to hisblindly-doting—eh?'

I thought, more than once, that it was well no serious cause of division hadever come between them; or two such natures—I ought rather to express  it,  twosuch shades of the same nature—might have been harder to reconcile than the twoextremest opposites in creation.

He was not so  much\\nsurprised to see me as I had expected.

The coldness of her  hand\\nwhen I touched it, I can feel yet. Its only sign of animation was to  shrink frommine; and then she glided from the chair, and creeping to the other side of  heruncle, bowed herself, silently and trembling still, upon his breast.\\n'It's such a loving art,' said Mr. Peggotty, smoothing her rich hair with  his  great\\nhard hand, 'that it can't abear the sorrer of this.

Even when he kissed her—\\nand I never saw him approach her, but I felt that nature had given him the soul of agentleman—she seemed to cling closer to her uncle, even to the avoidance of herchosen husband. I shut the door after him, that it might cause no disturbance of thequiet that prevailed; and when I turned back, I found Mr. Peggotty still talking toher.\\n'Now, I'm a going upstairs to tell your aunt as Mas'r Davy's here, and that'll cheer\\nher up a bit,' he said.

But there'll be someone else, soon,—someone else, soon, Em'ly!'\\nAfterwards, when I went upstairs, as I passed the door of my little chamber, which\\nwas dark, I had an indistinct impression of her being within it, cast down upon thefloor. But, whether it was really she, or whether it was a confusion of the shadowsin the room, I don't know now.\\nI had leisure to think, before the kitchen fire, of pretty little Emily's dread of death\\n—which, added to what Mr. Omer had told me, I took to be the cause of her beingso unlike herself—and I had leisure, before Peggotty came down, even to thinkmore leniently of the weakness of it: as I sat counting the ticking of the clock, anddeepening my sense of the solemn hush around me. Peggotty took me in her arms,and blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to her(that was what she said) in her distress. She then entreated me to come upstairs,sobbing that Mr. Barkis had always liked me and admired me; that he had oftentalked of me, before he fell into a stupor; and that she believed, in case of  hiscoming to himself again, he would brighten up at sight of me, if he could brightenup at any earthly thing.\\nThe probability of his ever doing so, appeared to me, when I saw him, to be very\\nsmall. He was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed, in an uncomfortableattitude, half resting on the box which had cost him so much pain and trouble. Ilearned, that, when he was past creeping out of bed to open it, and past assuringhimself of its safety by means of the divining rod I had seen him use, he hadrequired to have it placed on the chair at the bed-side, where he  had  ever  sinceembraced it, night and day. His arm lay on it now. Time and the world  wereslipping from beneath him, but the box was there; and the last words he had utteredwere (in an explanatory tone) 'Old clothes!'\\n'Barkis, my dear!' said Peggotty, almost cheerfully: bending over him, while  her\\nbrother and I stood at the bed's foot. 'Here's my dear boy—my dear boy, MasterDavy, who brought us together, Barkis! That you sent messages by, you know!Won't you speak to Master Davy?'\\nHe was as mute and senseless as the box, from which his form derived the only\\nexpression it had.\\n'He's a going out with the tide,' said Mr. Peggotty to me, behind his hand.My eyes were dim and so were Mr. Peggotty's; but I repeated in a whisper, 'With\\nthe tide?'\"),\n",

A GREATER LOSS\\nIt was not difficult for me, on Peggotty's solicitation, to resolve to stay where I was,\\nuntil after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey toBlunderstone. She had long ago bought, out of her own savings, a little piece ofground in our old churchyard near the grave of 'her sweet girl', as she always calledmy mother; and there they were to rest.\\nIn keeping Peggotty company, and doing all I could for her (little enough at the\\nutmost), I was as grateful, I rejoice to think, as even now I could wish myself tohave been. But I am afraid I had a supreme satisfaction, of a personal andprofessional nature, in taking charge of Mr. Barkis's will, and expounding itscontents.\\nI may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be\\nlooked for in the box. After some search, it was found in the box, at the bottom of ahorse's nose-bag; wherein (besides hay) there was discovered an old gold watch,with chain and seals, which Mr. Barkis had worn on his  wedding-day, and whichhad never been seen before or since; a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg;an imitation lemon, full of minute cups and saucers, which I have some idea Mr.Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child,  and afterwardsfound himself unable to part with; eighty-seven guineas and a half, in guineas andhalf-guineas; two hundred and ten pounds, in perfectly clean Bank notes; certain\"),\n",

His property in money\\namounted to nearly three thousand pounds.

All the rest he died possessed of, he bequeathed to Peggotty;whom he left residuary legatee, and sole executrix of that his last will andtestament.\\nI felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all possible\\nceremony, and set forth its provisions, any number of times, to those whom theyconcerned. I began to think there was more in the Commons than I had supposed. Iexamined the will with the deepest attention, pronounced it perfectly formal in allrespects, made a pencil-mark or so in the margin, and thought it ratherextraordinary that I knew so much.\\nIn this abstruse pursuit; in making an account for Peggotty, of all the property into\\nwhich she had come; in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner; and in beingher referee and adviser on every point, to our joint delight; I passed  the  weekbefore the funeral. I did not see little Emily in that interval, but they told me shewas to be quietly married in a fortnight.\\nI did not attend the funeral in character, if I may venture to say so. I mean I was\\nnot dressed up in a black coat and a streamer, to frighten the birds; but I walkedover to Blunderstone early in the morning, and was in the churchyard when  itcame, attended only by Peggotty and her brother. The mad gentleman looked on,out of my little window; Mr. Chillip's baby wagged its heavy head, and rolled itsgoggle eyes, at the clergyman, over its nurse's shoulder; Mr. Omer breathed shortin the background; no one else was there; and it was very quiet. We walked aboutthe churchyard for an hour, after all was over; and pulled some young leaves fromthe tree above my mother's grave.\\nA dread falls on me here. A cloud is lowering on the distant town, towards which I\\nretraced my solitary steps. I fear to approach it.

Deeply as I felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of  an  honesthome, I believed that if I had been brought face to face with him, I could not haveuttered one reproach. I should have loved him so well still—though he fascinatedme no longer—I should have held in so much tenderness the memory of myaffection for him, that I think I should have been as weak as a spirit-wounded child,in all but the entertainment of a thought that we could ever be re-united. Thatthought I never had. I felt, as he had felt, that all was at an end between us.

Among all kinds of peoplea respect for them in their distress prevailed, which was full of gentleness anddelicacy. The seafaring men kept apart, when those two were seen early, walkingwith slow steps on the beach; and stood in knots, talking compassionately amongthemselves.\\nIt was on the beach, close down by the sea, that I found them. It would have been\\neasy to perceive that they had not slept all last night, even if Peggotty had failed totell me of their still sitting just as I left them, when it was broad day. They lookedworn; and I thought Mr. Peggotty's head was bowed in one night more than in allthe years I had known him. But they were both as grave and steady as  the  seaitself, then lying beneath a dark sky, waveless—yet with a heavy roll upon it, as ifit breathed in its rest—and touched, on the horizon, with a strip of  silvery  lightfrom the unseen sun.\\n'We have had a mort of talk, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty to me, when we had all  three\\nwalked a little while in silence, 'of what we ought and doen't ought to do.

She\\nwas so devoted, she had such a quick perception of what it would be  well to say,and what it would be well to leave unsaid; she was so forgetful of herself, and soregardful of the sorrow about her, that I held her in a sort of veneration. The workshe did that day! There were many things to be brought up from  the  beach  andstored in the outhouse—as oars, nets, sails, cordage, spars, lobster-pots, bags  ofballast, and the like; and though there was abundance of assistance rendered, therebeing not a pair of working hands on all that shore but would have  laboured hardfor Mr. Peggotty, and been well paid in being asked to do it,  yet she persisted, allday long, in toiling under weights that she was quite unequal to, and fagging to andfro on all sorts of unnecessary errands. As to deploring her misfortunes, sheappeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any. Shepreserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy, which was not theleast astonishing part of the change that had come over her. Querulousness was outof the question. I did not even observe her voice to falter, or a tear to escape fromher eyes, the whole day through, until twilight; when she and I and Mr. Peggottybeing alone together, and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion, she brokeinto a half-suppressed fit of sobbing and crying, and taking me to the door, said,'Ever bless you, Mas'r Davy, be a friend to him, poor dear!' Then, she immediatelyran out of the house to wash her face, in order that she might sit quietly beside him,and be found at work there, when he should awake. In short I left her, when I wentaway at night, the prop and staff of Mr. Peggotty's affliction; and I could  notmeditate enough upon the lesson that I read in Mrs. Gummidge, and the newexperience she unfolded to me.\\nIt was between nine and ten o'clock when, strolling in a melancholy manner\"),\n",

It was not atrifling business to get the great umbrella up, and properly balanced in her grasp;but at last I successfully accomplished this, and saw it go bobbing down the streetthrough the rain, without the least appearance of having anybody underneath it,except when a heavier fall than usual from some over-charged water-spout sent ittoppling over, on one side, and discovered Miss Mowcher struggling violently toget it right. After making one or two sallies to her relief, which were rendered futileby the umbrella's hopping on again, like an immense bird, before I could reach it, Icame in, went to bed, and slept till morning.\\nIn the morning I was joined by Mr. Peggotty and by my old nurse, and we went at\\nan early hour to the coach office, where Mrs. Gummidge and Ham were waiting totake leave of us.\\n'Mas'r Davy,' Ham whispered, drawing me aside, while Mr. Peggotty was stowing\\nhis bag among the luggage, 'his life is quite broke up. He  doen't know wheer he'sgoing; he doen't know—what's afore him; he's bound upon a voyage that'll last, onand off, all the rest of his days, take my wured for 't, unless he finds what  he's aseeking of. I am sure you'll be a friend to him, Mas'r Davy?'\\n'Trust me, I will indeed,' said I, shaking hands with Ham earnestly.'Thankee. Thankee, very kind, sir. One thing furder. I'm in good employ, you know,\\nMas'r Davy, and I han't no way now of spending what I gets. Money's of no use tome no more, except to live. If you can lay it out for him, I shall do my work with abetter art. Though as to that, sir,' and he spoke very steadily and mildly, 'you're notto think but I shall work at all times, like a man, and act the best that  lays in mypower!'\\nI told him I was well convinced of it; and I hinted that I hoped the time might even\\ncome, when he would cease to lead the lonely life he naturally contemplated now.\\n'No, sir,' he said, shaking his head, 'all that's past and over with me, sir. No one can\\nnever fill the place that's empty. But you'll bear in mind about the money, as theer'sat all times some laying by for him?'\\nReminding him of the fact, that Mr. Peggotty derived a steady, though certainly a\\nvery moderate income from the bequest of his late brother-in-law, I promised to doso. We then took leave of each other. I cannot leave him even now, withoutremembering with a pang, at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow.\\nAs to Mrs. Gummidge, if I were to endeavour to describe how she ran down the\\nstreet by the side of the coach, seeing nothing but Mr. Peggotty on the roof, throughthe tears she tried to repress, and dashing herself against the people who werecoming in the opposite direction, I should enter on a task of some difficulty.Therefore I had better leave her sitting on a baker's door-step, out of breath, withno shape at all remaining in her bonnet, and one of her shoes off, lying on thepavement at a considerable distance.\"),\n",

We were so fortunate as\\nto find one, of a very clean and cheap description, over a chandler\\'s shop, only twostreets removed from me. When we had engaged this domicile, I bought some coldmeat at an eating-house, and took my fellow-travellers home to tea; a proceeding,I regret to state, which did not meet with Mrs. Crupp\\'s approval, but quite thecontrary. I ought to observe, however, in explanation of that lady\\'s state of mind,that she was much offended by Peggotty\\'s tucking up her widow\\'s gown before shehad been ten minutes in the place, and setting to work to dust my bedroom. ThisMrs. Crupp regarded in the light of a liberty, and a liberty, she said, was a thing shenever allowed.\\nMr. Peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to London for which I\\nwas not unprepared. It was, that he purposed first seeing Mrs. Steerforth. As I feltbound to assist him in this, and also to mediate between them; with the view ofsparing the mother\\'s feelings as much as possible, I wrote to her that  night. I toldher as mildly as I could what his wrong was, and what my own share in his injury.I said he was a man in very common life, but of a most gentle and uprightcharacter; and that I ventured to express a hope that she would not refuse to seehim in his heavy trouble. I mentioned two o\\'clock in the afternoon as the hour ofour coming, and I sent the letter myself by the first coach in the morning.\\nAt the appointed time, we stood at the door—the door of that house where I had\\nbeen, a few days since, so happy: where my youthful confidence and warmth ofheart had been yielded up so freely: which was closed against me henceforth:which was now a waste, a ruin.\\nNo Littimer appeared. The pleasanter face which had replaced his, on the occasion\\nof my last visit, answered to our summons, and went before us to  the  drawing -room. Mrs. Steerforth was sitting there. Rosa Dartle glided, as we  went  in,  fromanother part of the room and stood behind her chair.\\nI saw, directly, in his mother\\'s face, that she knew from himself what he had done.\\nIt was very pale; and bore the traces of deeper emotion than my letter alone,weakened by the doubts her fondness would have raised upon it, would have beenlikely to create. I thought her more like him than ever I had thought her; and I felt,rather than saw, that the resemblance was not lost on my companion.\\nShe sat upright in her arm-chair, with a stately, immovable,  passionless air,  that  it\\nseemed as if nothing could disturb. She looked very steadfastly at Mr.  Peggottywhen he stood before her; and he looked quite as steadfastly at her. Rosa Dartle\\'skeen glance comprehended all of us. For some moments not a word was spoken.\\nShe motioned to Mr. Peggotty to be seated. He said, in a low voice, \\'I shouldn\\'t feel\\nit nat\\'ral, ma\\'am, to sit down in this house. I\\'d sooner stand.\\' And this wassucceeded by another silence, which she broke thus:\\n\\'I know, with deep regret, what has brought you here. What do you want of me?\\nWhat do you ask me to do?\\'\\nHe put his hat under his arm, and feeling in his breast for Emily\\'s letter, took it out,\\nunfolded it, and gave it to her. \\'Please to read that, ma\\'am.

All the heaps of riches in thewureld would be nowt to me (if they was mine) to buy her back!  But,  save  herfrom this disgrace, and she shall never be disgraced by us. Not one of us that she'sgrowed up among, not one of us that's lived along with her and had her for their allin all, these many year, will ever look upon her pritty face again.

She still\\npreserved her proud manner, but there was a touch of softness in her voice, as sheanswered:\\n'I justify nothing. I make no counter-accusations. But I am sorry to repeat, it  is\\nimpossible. Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son's career, and ruin hisprospects. Nothing is more certain than that it never can take place, and never will.If there is any other compensation—'\\n'I am looking at the likeness of the face,' interrupted Mr. Peggotty, with a steady\\nbut a kindling eye, 'that has looked at me, in my home, at my fireside, in my boat—wheer not?—-smiling and friendly, when it was so treacherous, that I  go halfwild when I think of it.

And is this,' she added, looking at her visitor with the proudintolerant air with which she had begun, 'no injury?'\\nWhile I heard and saw the mother as she said these words, I seemed to hear and\\nsee the son, defying them. All that I had ever seen in him of an unyielding, wilfulspirit, I saw in her. All the understanding that I had now of his misdirected energy,became an understanding of her character too, and a perception that it was, in itsstrongest springs, the same.\\nShe now observed to me, aloud, resuming her former restraint, that it was useless to\\nhear more, or to say more, and that she begged to put an end to the interview. Sherose with an air of dignity to leave the room, when Mr. Peggotty signified  that  itwas needless.\\n'Doen't fear me being any hindrance to you, I have no more to say, ma'am,'  he\\nremarked, as he moved towards the door.

Its leaves and shoots were green then, and the day beingsunny, a pair of glass doors leading to the garden were thrown open. Rosa Dartle,entering this way with a noiseless step, when we were close to  them,  addressedherself to me:\\n'You do well,' she said, 'indeed, to bring this fellow here!'Such a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face, and flashed in her jet-\\nblack eyes, I could not have thought compressible even into that face. The  scarmade by the hammer was, as usual in this excited state of  her  features,  stronglymarked. When the throbbing I had seen before, came into it as I looked at her, sheabsolutely lifted up her hand, and struck it.\\n'This is a fellow,' she said, 'to champion and bring here, is he not?

'How can you bear to trample\\non his undeserved affliction!'\\n'I would trample on them all,' she answered. 'I would have his house pulled down. I\\nwould have her branded on the face, dressed in rags, and cast out in the streets tostarve. If I had the power to sit in judgement on her, I would see it done. See itdone? I would do it!

If I could hunt her to her grave, I would.If there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour,and only I possessed it, I wouldn't part with it for Life itself.'\\nThe mere vehemence of her words can convey, I am sensible, but a weak\\nimpression of the passion by which she was possessed, and which made  itselfarticulate in her whole figure, though her voice, instead of being raised, was lowerthan usual. No description I could give of her would do justice  to my recollectionof her, or to her entire deliverance of herself to her anger. I have seen passion inmany forms, but I have never seen it in such a form as that.\\nWhen I joined Mr. Peggotty, he was walking slowly and thoughtfully down  the\\nhill. He told me, as soon as I came up with him, that having now discharged hismind of what he had purposed doing in London, he meant 'to set out on his travels',that night. I asked him where he meant to go?

We followed to the door. It was a warm, dusty evening, just thetime when, in the great main thoroughfare out of which that  by-way turned, therewas a temporary lull in the eternal tread of feet upon the pavement, and a strongred sunshine. He turned, alone, at the corner of our shady street, into a  glow oflight, in which we lost him.\\nRarely did that hour of the evening come, rarely did I wake at night, rarely did I\\nlook up at the moon, or stars, or watch the falling rain, or hear the wind, but  Ithought of his solitary figure toiling on, poor pilgrim, and recalled the words:\\n\\'I\\'m a going to seek her, fur and wide.

BLISSFUL\\nAll this time, I had gone on loving Dora, harder than ever. Her idea was my refugein disappointment and distress, and made some amends to me, even for the loss ofmy friend. The more I pitied myself, or pitied others, the more I sought  forconsolation in the image of Dora. The greater the accumulation of deceit andtrouble in the world, the brighter and the purer shone the star of Dora high abovethe world. I don\\'t think I had any definite idea where Dora came from, or in whatdegree she was related to a higher order of beings; but I am  quite  sure  I  shouldhave scouted the notion of her being simply human, like any other young lady, withindignation and contempt.\\nIf I may so express it, I was steeped in Dora. I was not merely over head and ears\\nin love with her, but I was saturated through and through. Enough love might havebeen wrung out of me, metaphorically speaking, to drown anybody in; and yet therewould have remained enough within me, and all over me, to pervade my  entireexistence.\\nThe first thing I did, on my own account, when I came back, was to take a night-\\nwalk to Norwood, and, like the subject of a venerable riddle of my childhood, to go\\'round and round the house, without ever touching the house\\', thinking about Dora.I believe the theme of this incomprehensible conundrum was the moon.

Perhapsfrom mice, to which she had a great objection.\\nMy love was so much in my mind and it was so natural to me to  confide  in\\nPeggotty, when I found her again by my side of an evening with the old  set  ofindustrial implements, busily making the tour of my wardrobe, that I imparted toher, in a sufficiently roundabout way, my great secret. Peggotty was stronglyinterested, but I could not get her into my view of the case at all. She wasaudaciously prejudiced in my favour, and quite unable to understand why I shouldhave any misgivings, or be low-spirited about it. 'The young lady might thinkherself well off,' she observed, 'to have such a beau. And as to her Pa,' she said,'what did the gentleman expect, for gracious sake!'\\nI observed, however, that Mr. Spenlow's proctorial gown and stiff cravat took\\nPeggotty down a little, and inspired her with a greater reverence for the man whowas gradually becoming more and more etherealized in my eyes every  day,  andabout whom a reflected radiance seemed to me to beam when he sat erect in Courtamong his papers, like a little lighthouse in a sea of stationery. And by the  by, itused to be uncommonly strange to me to consider, I remember, as I sat in Courttoo, how those dim old judges and doctors wouldn't have cared for Dora, if theyhad known her; how they wouldn't have gone out of their senses with rapture, ifmarriage with Dora had been proposed to them; how Dora might have sung, andplayed upon that glorified guitar, until she led me to the verge of madness, yet nothave tempted one of those slow-goers an inch out of his road!\\nI despised them, to a man. Frozen-out old gardeners in the flower-beds of the\\nheart, I took a personal offence against them all. The Bench was nothing to me butan insensible blunderer. The Bar had no more tenderness or poetry in it, than thebar of a public-house.\\nTaking the management of Peggotty's affairs into my own hands, with no little\\npride, I proved the will, and came to a settlement with the Legacy Duty-office, andtook her to the Bank, and soon got everything into an orderly train. We varied thelegal character of these proceedings by going to see some perspiring Wax-work, inFleet Street (melted, I should hope, these twenty years); and by visiting MissLinwood's Exhibition, which I remember as a Mausoleum of needlework,favourable to self-examination and repentance; and by inspecting the Tower  ofLondon; and going to the top of St. Paul's. All these wonders afforded Peggotty asmuch pleasure as she was able to enjoy, under existing circumstances: except,  Ithink, St. Paul's, which, from her long attachment to her work-box, became a rivalof the picture on the lid, and was, in some particulars, vanquished, she considered,by that work of art.\\nPeggotty's business, which was what we used to call 'common -form business'  in\\nthe Commons (and very light and lucrative the common-form business was), beingsettled, I took her down to the office one morning to pay her bill. Mr. Spenlow hadstepped out, old Tiffey said, to get a gentleman sworn for a marriage licence; but asI knew he would be back directly, our place lying close to the Surrogate's, and tothe Vicar-General's office too, I told Peggotty to wait.\\nWe were a little like undertakers, in the Commons, as regarded Probate\\ntransactions; generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up, when we had to\"),\n",

NOT finding himself as comfortable as he expected, or being a little\\nfatigued with his wife, poor fellow, he now came forward, by a friend, after beingmarried a year or two, and declared that his name was Thomas Benjamin, andtherefore he was not married at all. Which the Court confirmed, to his  greatsatisfaction.\\nI must say that I had my doubts about the strict justice of this, and was not even\\nfrightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which reconciles all anomalies. ButMr. Spenlow argued the matter with me. He said, Look at the world, there  wasgood and evil in that; look at the ecclesiastical law, there was good and evil  inTHAT. It was all part of a system. Very good. There you were!\\nI had not the hardihood to suggest to Dora's father that possibly we  might  even\\nimprove the world a little, if we got up early in the morning, and took off our coatsto the work; but I confessed that I thought we might improve the Commons. Mr.Spenlow replied that he would particularly advise me to dismiss that idea from mymind, as not being worthy of my gentlemanly character; but that he would be gladto hear from me of what improvement I thought the Commons susceptible?\\nTaking that part of the Commons which happened to be nearest to us—for our man\\nwas unmarried by this time, and we were out of Court, and strolling past  thePrerogative Office—I submitted that I thought the Prerogative Office rather aqueerly managed institution. Mr. Spenlow inquired in what respect? I replied, withall due deference to his experience (but with more deference, I am afraid, to hisbeing Dora's father), that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of thatCourt, containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects within theimmense province of Canterbury, for three whole centuries, should be an accidentalbuilding, never designed for the purpose, leased by the registrars for their Ownprivate emolument, unsafe, not even ascertained to be fire-proof, choked with theimportant documents it held, and positively, from the roof to the basement, amercenary speculation of the registrars, who took great fees from the public, andcrammed the public's wills away anyhow and anywhere, having no other objectthan to get rid of them cheaply. That, perhaps, it was a little unreasonable that theseregistrars in the receipt of profits amounting to eight or nine thousand  pounds  ayear (to say nothing of the profits of the deputy registrars, and clerks of  seats),should not be obliged to spend a little of that  money, in finding a reasonably safeplace for the important documents which all classes of people were compelled tohand over to them, whether they would or no. That, perhaps, it was a little unjust,that all the great offices in this great office should be magnificent sinecures, whilethe unfortunate working-clerks in the cold dark room upstairs were the worstrewarded, and the least considered men, doing important services, in London. Thatperhaps it was a little indecent that the principal registrar of all, whose duty it wasto find the public, constantly resorting to this place, all needful  accommodation,should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post (and might be, besides, aclergyman, a pluralist, the holder of a staff in a cathedral, and what not),—whilethe public was put to the inconvenience of which we had a specimen everyafternoon when the office was busy, and which we knew to be quite monstrous.That, perhaps, in short, this Prerogative Office of the diocese of  Canterbury  wasaltogether such a pestilent job, and such a pernicious absurdity, that but for itsbeing squeezed away in a corner of St. Paul's Churchyard, which few people knew,it must have been turned completely inside out, and upside down, long ago.\\nMr. Spenlow smiled as I became modestly warm on the subject, and then argued\"),\n",

Under the Prerogative Office, thecountry had been glorious. Insert the wedge into the Prerogative Office,  and  thecountry would cease to be glorious. He considered it the principle of a gentleman totake things as he found them; and he had no doubt the Prerogative Office wouldlast our time. I deferred to his opinion, though I had great doubts of it myself. Ifind he was right, however; for it has not only lasted to the present moment, buthas done so in the teeth of a great parliamentary report made (not too willingly)eighteen years ago, when all these objections of mine were set forth in detail, andwhen the existing stowage for wills was described as equal to the accumulation ofonly two years and a half more. What they have done with  them  since;  whetherthey have lost many, or whether they sell any, now and then, to the butter shops; Idon't know. I am glad mine is not there, and I hope it may not go there, yet awhile.\\nI have set all this down, in my present blissful chapter, because here it comes into\\nits natural place. Mr. Spenlow and I falling into this conversation, prolonged it andour saunter to and fro, until we diverged into general topics. And so it came about,in the end, that Mr. Spenlow told me this day week was Dora's birthday, and hewould be glad if I would come down and join a little picnic on the occasion. I wentout of my senses immediately; became a mere driveller next day, on receipt of alittle lace-edged sheet of note-paper, 'Favoured by papa. To remind'; and passed theintervening period in a state of dotage.\\nI think I committed every possible absurdity in the way of preparation for this\\nblessed event. I turn hot when I remember the cravat I bought. My boots might beplaced in any collection of instruments of torture. I provided, and sent down by theNorwood coach the night before, a delicate little hamper, amounting in itself, Ithought, almost to a declaration. There were crackers in it with the  tenderestmottoes that could be got for money. At six in the morning, I was in  CoventGarden Market, buying a bouquet for Dora. At ten I was on horseback (I hired agallant grey, for the occasion), with the bouquet in my hat, to keep it fresh, trottingdown to Norwood.\\nI suppose that when I saw Dora in the garden and pretended not to see her, and\\nrode past the house pretending to be anxiously looking for it, I committed twosmall fooleries which other young gentlemen in my circumstances might havecommitted—because they came so very natural to me. But oh! when I DID find thehouse, and DID dismount at the garden-gate, and drag those stony-hearted bootsacross the lawn to Dora sitting on a garden-seat under a lilac tree, what a spectacleshe was, upon that beautiful morning, among the butterflies, in a white chip bonnetand a dress of celestial blue! There was a young lady with her—comparativelystricken in years—almost twenty, I should say. Her name was Miss Mills. AndDora called her Julia. She was the bosom friend of Dora. Happy Miss Mills!\\nJip was there, and Jip WOULD bark at me again. When I presented my bouquet, he\\ngnashed his teeth with jealousy. Well he might.

Then Dora laughed, and held them a little closer to Jip, to make him. ThenJip laid hold of a bit of geranium with his teeth, and worried imaginary cats in it.Then Dora beat him, and pouted, and said, 'My poor beautiful flowers!' ascompassionately, I thought, as if Jip had laid hold of me. I wished he had!\\n'You'll be so glad to hear, Mr. Copperfield,' said Dora, 'that that cross Miss\\nMurdstone is not here. She has gone to her brother's marriage, and will be away atleast three weeks. Isn't that delightful?'\\nI said I was sure it must be delightful to her, and all that was delightful to her was\\ndelightful to me. Miss Mills, with an air of superior wisdom and  benevolence,smiled upon us.\\n'She is the most disagreeable thing I ever saw,' said Dora. 'You can't believe how\\nill-tempered and shocking she is, Julia.'\\n'Yes, I can, my dear!' said Julia.'YOU can, perhaps, love,' returned Dora, with her hand on julia's. 'Forgive my not\\nexcepting you, my dear, at first.'\\nI learnt, from this, that Miss Mills had had her trials  in the course of a chequered\\nexistence; and that to these, perhaps, I might refer that wise benignity of mannerwhich I had already noticed. I found, in the course of the day, that this was thecase: Miss Mills having been unhappy in a misplaced affection, and beingunderstood to have retired from the world on her awful stock of experience, butstill to take a calm interest in the unblighted hopes and loves of youth.\\nBut now Mr. Spenlow came out of the house, and Dora went to him, saying, 'Look,\\npapa, what beautiful flowers!' And Miss Mills smiled thoughtfully, as who shouldsay, 'Ye Mayflies, enjoy your brief existence in the bright morning of life!' And weall walked from the lawn towards the carriage, which was getting ready.\\nI shall never have such a ride again. I have never had such another. There were\\nonly those three, their hamper, my hamper, and the guitar-case, in the phaeton; and,of course, the phaeton was open; and I rode behind it, and Dora sat with her backto the horses, looking towards me. She kept the bouquet close to her on the cushion,and wouldn't allow Jip to sit on that side of her at all, for fear he should crush it.She often carried it in her hand, often refreshed herself with its fragrance. Our eyesat those times often met; and my great astonishment is that I didn't go over the headof my gallant grey into the carriage.\\nThere was dust, I believe. There was a good deal of dust, I believe. I have a faint\\nimpression that Mr. Spenlow remonstrated with me for riding in it; but I knew ofnone. I was sensible of a mist of love and beauty about Dora, but of nothing else.He stood up sometimes, and asked me what I thought of the prospect. I said it wasdelightful, and I dare say it was; but it was all Dora to me. The sun shone Dora,and the birds sang Dora. The south wind blew Dora, and the wild flowers in thehedges were all Doras, to a bud. My comfort is, Miss Mills understood me.

But all of my own sex—especially one impostor, threeor four years my elder, with a red whisker, on which  he established an amount  ofpresumption not to be endured—were my mortal foes.\\nWe all unpacked our baskets, and employed ourselves in getting dinner ready. Red\\nWhisker pretended he could make a salad (which I don't believe), and  obtrudedhimself on public notice. Some of the young ladies washed the lettuces for him, andsliced them under his directions. Dora was among these. I felt that  fate had pittedme against this man, and one of us must fall.\\nRed Whisker made his salad (I wondered how they could eat it.  Nothing  should\\nhave induced ME to touch it!) and voted himself into the charge of the wine-cellar,which he constructed, being an ingenious beast, in the hollow trunk of a tree. Byand by, I saw him, with the majority of a lobster on his  plate, eating his dinner atthe feet of Dora!\\nI have but an indistinct idea of what happened for some time after this baleful\\nobject presented itself to my view. I was very merry, I know; but it was hollowmerriment. I attached myself to a young creature in pink, with little eyes,  andflirted with her desperately. She received my attentions with favour; but whether onmy account solely, or because she had any designs on Red Whisker, I can't say.Dora's health was drunk. When I drank it, I affected to interrupt my conversationfor that purpose, and to resume it immediately afterwards. I caught Dora's eye as Ibowed to her, and I thought it looked appealing. But it looked at me over the headof Red Whisker, and I was adamant.\\nThe young creature in pink had a mother in green; and I rather think the  latter\\nseparated us from motives of policy. Howbeit, there was a general breaking up ofthe party, while the remnants of the dinner were being put away; and I strolled offby myself among the trees, in a raging and remorseful state. I was  debatingwhether I should pretend that I was not well, and fly—I don't know where—uponmy gallant grey, when Dora and Miss Mills met me.\\n'Mr. Copperfield,' said Miss Mills, 'you are dull.'I begged her pardon. Not at all.'And Dora,' said Miss Mills, 'YOU are dull.'Oh dear no! Not in the least.'Mr. Copperfield and Dora,' said Miss Mills, with an almost venerable air. 'Enough\\nof this. Do not allow a trivial misunderstanding to wither the blossoms of spring,which, once put forth and blighted, cannot be renewed. I speak,' said Miss Mills,'from experience of the past—the remote, irrevocable past.

So Red Whisker was done for in a moment; and I got it, and I unlockedit, and I took the guitar out, and I sat by her, and I held her handkerchief  andgloves, and I drank in every note of her dear voice, and she sang to ME who lovedher, and all the others might applaud as much as they liked, but they had nothing todo with it!\\nI was intoxicated with joy.

She admired my horse and patted him—oh, what a dear littlehand it looked upon a horse!—and her shawl would not keep right, and now andthen I drew it round her with my arm; and I even fancied that Jip began to see howit was, and to understand that he must make up his mind to be friends with me.\\nThat sagacious Miss Mills, too; that amiable, though quite used up, recluse;  that\\nlittle patriarch of something less than twenty, who had done with the world, andmustn't on any account have the slumbering echoes in the caverns of  Memoryawakened; what a kind thing she did!\\n'Mr. Copperfield,' said Miss Mills, 'come to this side of the carriage a moment—if\\nyou can spare a moment.

Mrs. Crupp, after holding divers conversations respectingPeggotty, in a very high-pitched voice, on the staircase—with some invisibleFamiliar it would appear, for corporeally speaking she was quite alone at thosetimes—addressed a letter to me, developing her views. Beginning it with thatstatement of universal application, which fitted every occurrence of her life,namely, that she was a mother herself, she went on to inform me that she had onceseen very different days, but that at all periods of her existence she had had aconstitutional objection to spies, intruders, and informers. She named no names, shesaid; let them the cap fitted, wear it; but spies, intruders, and informers, especiallyin widders' weeds (this clause was underlined), she had ever accustomed herself tolook down upon. If a gentleman was the victim of spies, intruders, and informers(but still naming no names), that was his own pleasure. He had a right to pleasehimself; so let him do. All that she, Mrs. Crupp, stipulated for, was, that she shouldnot be 'brought in contract' with such persons. Therefore she begged to be excusedfrom any further attendance on the top set, until things were as they formerly was,and as they could be wished to be; and further mentioned that her little book wouldbe found upon the breakfast-table every Saturday morning, when she requested animmediate settlement of the same, with the benevolent view of saving trouble 'andan ill-conwenience' to all parties.\\nAfter this, Mrs. Crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the  stairs, principally\\nwith pitchers, and endeavouring to delude Peggotty into breaking her legs. I foundit rather harassing to live in this state of siege, but was too much afraid of Mrs.Crupp to see any way out of it.\\n'My dear Copperfield,' cried Traddles, punctually appearing at my door, in spite of\\nall these obstacles, 'how do you do?'\\n'My dear Traddles,' said I, 'I am delighted to see you at last, and very sorry I have\\nnot been at home before. But I have been so much engaged—'\\n'Yes, yes, I know,' said Traddles, 'of course.

I suppose it is,\\nCopperfield, because there is no help for it?'\\n'I suppose so,' I replied with a smile, and not without a blush. 'And because you\\nhave so much constancy and patience, Traddles.'\\n'Dear me!' said Traddles, considering about it, 'do I strike you in that  way,\\nCopperfield? Really I didn't know that I had.

I exclaimed indignantly.'It was a—it was a pull,' said Traddles, with his usual wince at that  expression. 'I\\ndon't mention it reproachfully, however, but with a motive. The fact is,Copperfield, I was unable to repurchase them at the time of their  seizure;  in  thefirst place, because the broker, having an idea that I wanted them, ran the price upto an extravagant extent; and, in the second place, because I—hadn't any money.Now, I have kept my eye since, upon the broker's shop,' said Traddles, with a greatenjoyment of his mystery, 'which is up at the top of Tottenham Court Road, and, atlast, today I find them put out for sale.

After\\na little further conversation, we went round to the chandler's shop, to enlistPeggotty; Traddles declining to pass the evening with me, both because he enduredthe liveliest apprehensions that his property would be bought by somebody elsebefore he could re-purchase it, and because it was the evening he always devoted towriting to the dearest girl in the world.\\nI never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street in Tottenham Court\\nRoad, while Peggotty was bargaining for the precious articles; or his agitation whenshe came slowly towards us after vainly offering a price, and was hailed  by therelenting broker, and went back again.

DEPRESSION\\nAs soon as I could recover my presence of mind, which quite deserted me in thefirst overpowering shock of my aunt's intelligence, I proposed to Mr. Dick to comeround to the chandler's shop, and take possession of the bed which Mr. Peggottyhad lately vacated. The chandler's shop being in Hungerford Market, andHungerford Market being a very different place in those days, there was a low\"),\n",

The glory of lodging over this structure would have compensatedhim, I dare say, for many inconveniences; but, as there were really  few  to  bear,beyond the compound of flavours I have already mentioned, and perhaps the wantof a little more elbow-room, he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation.Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that there wasn't room to swing a cat there;but, as Mr. Dick justly observed to me, sitting down on the foot of the bed, nursinghis leg, 'You know, Trotwood, I don't want to swing a cat. I never do swing a cat.Therefore, what does that signify to ME!'\\nI tried to ascertain whether Mr. Dick had any understanding of the causes of this\\nsudden and great change in my aunt's affairs. As I might have  expected,  he  hadnone at all. The only account he could give of it was, that my aunt had said to him,the day before yesterday, 'Now, Dick, are you really and truly the  philosopher  Itake you for?' That then he had said, Yes, he hoped so. That then my aunt had said,'Dick, I am ruined.' That then he had said, 'Oh, indeed!' That then my  aunt  hadpraised him highly, which he was glad of. And that then they had come to me, andhad had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road.\\nMr. Dick was so very complacent, sitting on the foot of the bed, nursing his  leg,\\nand telling me this, with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile, that I am sorryto say I was provoked into explaining to him that ruin meant distress, want, andstarvation; but I was soon bitterly reproved for this harshness, by seeing his faceturn pale, and tears course down his lengthened cheeks, while he fixed upon me alook of such unutterable woe, that it might have softened a far harder heart thanmine. I took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than I had taken todepress him; and I soon understood (as I ought to have known at first) that he hadbeen so confident, merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful ofwomen, and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual resources. The latter, Ibelieve, he considered a match for any kind of disaster not absolutely mortal.\\n'What can we do, Trotwood?' said Mr. Dick. 'There's the Memorial-''To be sure there is,' said I. 'But all we can do just now, Mr. Dick, is to keep a\\ncheerful countenance, and not let my aunt see that we are thinking about it.'\\nHe assented to this in the most earnest manner; and implored me, if I should see\\nhim wandering an inch out of the right course, to recall him by some of thosesuperior methods which were always at my command. But I regret to state that thefright I had given him proved too much for his best attempts at concealment. Allthe evening his eyes wandered to my aunt's face, with an expression of the mostdismal apprehension, as if he saw her growing thin on the spot. He was consciousof this, and put a constraint upon his head; but his keeping that immovable, andsitting rolling his eyes like a piece of machinery, did not mend the matter at all.  Isaw him look at the loaf at supper (which happened to be a small one),  as  ifnothing else stood between us and famine; and when my aunt insisted on hismaking his customary repast, I detected him in the act of pocketing fragments ofhis bread and cheese; I have no doubt for the purpose of reviving us with thosesavings, when we should have reached an advanced stage of attenuation.\\nMy aunt, on the other hand, was in a composed frame of mind, which was a lesson\\nto all of us—to me, I am sure. She was extremely gracious to Peggotty,  exceptwhen I inadvertently called her by that name; and, strange as I knew she felt inLondon, appeared quite at home. She was to have my bed, and I was to lie  in thesitting-room, to keep guard over her. She made a great point of being so near the\"),\n",

I warmed the ale and made the toast on the usualinfallible principles. When it was ready for her, she was ready for it,  with  hernightcap on, and the skirt of her gown turned back on her knees.\\n'My dear,' said my aunt, after taking a spoonful of it; 'it's a great deal better than\\nwine. Not half so bilious.'\\nI suppose I looked doubtful, for she added:'Tut, tut, child. If nothing worse than Ale happens to us, we are well off.''I should think so myself, aunt, I am sure,' said I.'Well, then, why DON'T you think so?' said my aunt.'Because you and I are very different people,' I returned.'Stuff and nonsense, Trot!' replied my aunt.MY aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment, in which there was very little affectation,\\nif any; drinking the warm ale with a tea-spoon, and soaking her strips of toast in it.\\n'Trot,' said she, 'I don't care for strange faces in general, but I rather like that Barkis\\nof yours, do you know!'\\n'It's better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so!' said I.'It's a most extraordinary world,' observed my aunt, rubbing her nose; 'how  that\\nwoman ever got into it with that name, is unaccountable to me. It would be  muchmore easy to be born a Jackson, or something of that sort, one would think.'\\n'Perhaps she thinks so, too; it's not her fault,' said I.'I suppose not,' returned my aunt, rather grudging the admission; 'but it's very\\naggravating.

How I thought and thought about my\\nbeing poor, in Mr. Spenlow's eyes; about my not being what I thought I was, whenI proposed to Dora; about the chivalrous necessity of telling Dora what my worldlycondition was, and releasing her from her engagement if she thought fit; about howI should contrive to live, during the long term of my articles, when I was earningnothing; about doing something to assist my aunt, and seeing no way of doinganything; about coming down to have no money in my pocket, and to  wear  ashabby coat, and to be able to carry Dora no little presents, and to ride no gallantgreys, and to show myself in no agreeable light! Sordid and selfish as I knew itwas, and as I tortured myself by knowing that it was, to let my mind run on myown distress so much, I was so devoted to Dora that I could not help it. I knew thatit was base in me not to think more of my aunt, and less of myself; but, so far,selfishness was inseparable from Dora, and I could not put Dora on one side forany mortal creature.

The man who had been playing  the harp allnight, was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinary-sized nightcap, when I awoke;or I should rather say, when I left off trying to go to sleep, and saw the sun shiningin through the window at last.\\nThere was an old Roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out\\nof the Strand—it may be there still—in which I have had many a cold  plunge.Dressing myself as quietly as I could, and leaving Peggotty to look after my aunt, Itumbled head foremost into it, and then went for a walk to Hampstead. I  had  ahope that this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little; and I think it did themgood, for I soon came to the conclusion that the first step I ought to take was, to tryif my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered. I got some breakfaston the Heath, and walked back to Doctors' Commons, along the watered roads andthrough a pleasant smell of summer flowers, growing in gardens and carried intotown on hucksters' heads, intent on this first effort to meet our alteredcircumstances.\\nI arrived at the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's loitering about the\\nCommons, before old Tiffey, who was always first, appeared with his key. Then Isat down in my shady corner, looking up at the sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking about Dora; until Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly.\\n'How are you, Copperfield?' said he. 'Fine morning!''Beautiful morning, sir,' said I. 'Could I say a word to you before you go into\\nCourt?'\\n'By all means,' said he. 'Come into my room.'I followed him into his room, and he began putting on his gown, and touching\\nhimself up before a little glass he had, hanging inside a closet door.\\n'I am sorry to say,' said I, 'that I have some rather disheartening intelligence from\\nmy aunt.'\\n'No!' said he. 'Dear me! Not paralysis, I hope?''It has no reference to her health, sir,' I replied. 'She has met with some large losses.\\nIn fact, she has very little left, indeed.'\\n'You as-tound me, Copperfield!' cried Mr. Spenlow.I shook my head. 'Indeed, sir,' said I, 'her affairs are so changed, that  I wished to\\nask you whether it would be possible—at a sacrifice on our part of some portion ofthe premium, of course,' I put in this, on the spur of the moment, warned by theblank expression of his face—'to cancel my articles?'\"),\n",

'Come in!'I went in, and sat down; and stated my case to Mr. jorkins pretty much as I had\\nstated it to Mr. Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins was not by any means the awful creature onemight have expected, but a large, mild, smooth-faced man of sixty, who took somuch snuff that there was a tradition in the Commons that  he lived  principally onthat stimulant, having little room in his system for any other article of diet.\"),\n",

Mr.\\nWickfield, left to Agnes, soon became more like his former self; though there was asettled depression upon him, which he never shook off. For all that, he brightened;and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life,many of which he remembered very well. He said it was like those  times,  to  bealone with Agnes and me again; and he wished to Heaven they had never changed.I am sure there was an influence in the placid face of Agnes, and in the very touchof her hand upon his arm, that did wonders for him.\\nMy aunt (who was busy nearly all this while with Peggotty, in the inner  room)\\nwould not accompany us to the place where they were staying, but insisted on mygoing; and I went.

He took what she gave him, and no more—like achild—and we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in. Whenit was almost dark, he lay down on a sofa, Agnes pillowing his head and bendingover him a little while; and when she came back to the window, it was not so darkbut I could see tears glittering in her eyes.\\nI pray Heaven that I never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth, at that\\ntime of my life; for if I should, I must be drawing near the end, and then I woulddesire to remember her best! She filled my heart with such good resolutions,strengthened my weakness so, by her example, so directed—I know not how, shewas too modest and gentle to advise me in many words—the wandering ardour andunsettled purpose within me, that all the little good I have done, and all the harm Ihave forborne, I solemnly believe I may refer to her.\\nAnd how she spoke to me of Dora, sitting at the window in the dark; listened to my\\npraises of her; praised again; and round the little fairy-figure shed some glimpsesof her own pure light, that made it yet more precious and more innocent to me!

What I had to do, was, to show my aunt that her past goodness to me\\nhad not been thrown away on an insensible, ungrateful object. What I had to do,was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to workwith a resolute and steady heart. What I had to do, was, to take my woodman's axein my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cuttingdown the trees until I came to Dora. And I went on at a mighty rate, as if it couldbe done by walking.\\nWhen I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such a  different\\nerrand from that old one of pleasure, with which it was associated, it seemed as if acomplete change had come on my whole life. But that did not discourage me. Withthe new life, came new purpose, new intention. Great was the labour; priceless thereward. Dora was the reward, and Dora must be won.\\nI got into such a transport, that I felt quite sorry my coat was not a little shabby\\nalready. I wanted to be cutting at those trees in the forest of difficulty,  undercircumstances that should prove my strength. I had a good mind to ask an old man,in wire spectacles, who was breaking stones upon the road, to lend me his hammerfor a little while, and let me begin to beat a path to Dora out of granite. I stimulatedmyself into such a heat, and got so out of breath, that I felt as if I had been earningI don't know how much.\\nIn this state, I went into a cottage that I saw was to let, and examined it narrowly,\\n—for I felt it necessary to be practical. It would do for me and Dora admirably:with a little front garden for Jip to run about in, and bark at  the  tradespeoplethrough the railings, and a capital room upstairs for my aunt. I came out  again,hotter and faster than ever, and dashed up to Highgate, at such a rate that I wasthere an hour too early; and, though I had not been, should have been obliged  tostroll about to cool myself, before I was at all presentable.\\nMy first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation, was\\nto find the Doctor's house. It was not in that part of Highgate where Mrs. Steerforthlived, but quite on the opposite side of the little town. When I had made  thisdiscovery, I went back, in an attraction I could not resist, to a lane by Mrs.Steerforth's, and looked over the corner of the garden wall. His room was shut upclose. The conservatory doors were standing open, and Rosa Dartle was walking,bareheaded, with a quick, impetuous step, up and down a gravel walk on one sideof the lawn. She gave me the idea of some fierce thing, that was dragging thelength of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track, and wearing its heart out.\\nI came softly away from my place of observation, and avoiding that part  of  the\\nneighbourhood, and wishing I had not gone near it, strolled about until it was teno'clock. The church with the slender spire, that stands on the top of the hill now,was not there then to tell me the time. An old red-brick mansion, used as a school,was in its place; and a fine old house it must have been to go to school at, as Irecollect it.\\nWhen I approached the Doctor's cottage—a pretty old place, on which  he seemed\\nto have expended some money, if I might judge from the embellishments  andrepairs that had the look of being just completed—I saw him walking in the gardenat the side, gaiters and all, as if he had never left off walking since the days of mypupilage. He had his old companions about him, too; for there were plenty of hightrees in the neighbourhood, and two or three rooks were on the grass, looking afterhim, as if they had been written to about him by the Canterbury rooks, and wereobserving him closely in consequence.\"),\n",

How do you do? I am\\ndelighted to see you. My dear Copperfield, how very much you have  improved!You are quite—yes—dear me!'\\nI hoped he was well, and Mrs. Strong too.'Oh dear, yes!' said the Doctor; 'Annie's quite well, and she'll be delighted to see\\nyou.

And—yes, to be sure—you recollect Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?'\\n'Perfectly, sir.''Of course,' said the Doctor. 'To be sure. He's pretty well, too.''Has he come home, sir?' I inquired.'From India?' said the Doctor. 'Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon couldn't bear the climate, my\\ndear. Mrs. Markleham—you have not forgotten Mrs. Markleham?'\\nForgotten the Old Soldier! And in that short time!'Mrs. Markleham,' said the Doctor, 'was quite vexed about him, poor thing; so we\\nhave got him at home again; and we have bought him a little Patent  place, whichagrees with him much better.' I knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect fromthis account that it was a place where there was not much to do, and which waspretty well paid. The Doctor, walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder,and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine, went on:\\n'Now, my dear Copperfield, in reference to this proposal of yours. It's very\\ngratifying and agreeable to me, I am sure; but don't you think you could do better?You achieved distinction, you know, when you were with us. You are qualified formany good things. You have laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon;and is it not a pity that you should devote the spring-time of your life to such apoor pursuit as I can offer?'\\nI became very glowing again, and, expressing myself in a rhapsodical style, I am\\nafraid, urged my request strongly; reminding the Doctor that I had already  aprofession.\\n'Well, well,' said the Doctor, 'that's true. Certainly, your having a profession, and\\nbeing actually engaged in studying it, makes a difference. But, my good youngfriend, what's seventy pounds a year?'\\n'It doubles our income, Doctor Strong,' said I.'Dear me!' replied the Doctor. 'To think of that! Not that I mean to say it's rigidly\\nlimited to seventy pounds a-year, because I have always contemplated making anyyoung friend I might thus employ, a present too.

'To think that so little should go for so\\nmuch! Dear, dear! And when you can do better, you will? On your word, now?'said the Doctor,—which he had always made a very grave appeal to the honour ofus boys.\\n'On my word, sir!' I returned, answering in our old school manner.'Then be it so,' said the Doctor, clapping me on the shoulder, and still keeping his\\nhand there, as we still walked up and down.\\n'And I shall be twenty times happier, sir,' said I, with a little—I hope innocent—\\nflattery, 'if my employment is to be on the Dictionary.'\\nThe Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped me on the shoulder again, and exclaimed,\\nwith a triumph most delightful to behold, as if I had penetrated to the profoundestdepths of mortal sagacity, 'My dear young friend, you have hit it. It IS theDictionary!'\\nHow could it be anything else! His pockets were as full of it as his head. It was\\nsticking out of him in all directions. He told me that since his retirement fromscholastic life, he had been advancing with it wonderfully; and that  nothing couldsuit him better than the proposed arrangements for morning and evening work, as itwas his custom to walk about in the daytime with his considering cap on. Hispapers were in a little confusion, in consequence of Mr. Jack Maldon having latelyproffered his occasional services as an amanuensis, and not being accustomed tothat occupation; but we should soon put right what was amiss, and go onswimmingly. Afterwards, when we were fairly at our work, I found Mr. JackMaldon's efforts more troublesome to me than I had expected, as he had notconfined himself to making numerous mistakes, but had sketched so many soldiers,and ladies' heads, over the Doctor's manuscript, that I often became involved  inlabyrinths of obscurity.\\nThe Doctor was quite happy in the prospect of our going to work together on that\\nwonderful performance, and we settled to begin next morning at seven o'clock. Wewere to work two hours every morning, and two or three hours every night, excepton Saturdays, when I was to rest. On Sundays, of course, I was to rest also, and Iconsidered these very easy terms.\\nOur plans being thus arranged to our mutual satisfaction, the Doctor took me into\\nthe house to present me to Mrs. Strong, whom we found in the Doctor's new study,dusting his books,—a freedom which he never permitted anybody else to take withthose sacred favourites.\\nThey had postponed their breakfast on my account, and we sat down to table\\ntogether. We had not been seated long, when I saw an approaching arrival in Mrs.Strong's face, before I heard any sound of it. A gentleman on horseback came to thegate, and leading his horse into the little court, with the bridle over his arm, as if hewere quite at home, tied him to a ring in the empty coach-house wall, and cameinto the breakfast parlour, whip in hand.

Perhaps it impressed methe more then, because it was new to me, but it certainly did not tend to exalt myopinion of, or to strengthen my confidence in, Mr. Jack Maldon.\\n'I came out to inquire whether Annie would like to go to the opera tonight,' said\\nMr. Maldon, turning to her. 'It's the last good night there will be, this season; andthere's a singer there, whom she really ought to hear. She is  perfectly  exquisite.Besides which, she is so charmingly ugly,' relapsing into languor.\\nThe Doctor, ever pleased with what was likely to please his young wife,  turned to\\nher and said:\\n'You must go, Annie.

I would\\nmuch rather remain at home.'\\nWithout looking at her cousin, she then addressed me, and asked me about Agnes,\\nand whether she should see her, and whether she was not likely to come that day;and was so much disturbed, that I wondered how even the Doctor,  buttering  histoast, could be blind to what was so obvious.\\nBut he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, that she was young and ought to\\nbe amused and entertained, and must not allow herself to be made dull by a  dullold fellow.

The gauntlet, to which Mrs. Micawber referred upon a formeroccasion, being thrown down in the form of an advertisement, was taken up by myfriend Heep, and led to a mutual recognition. Of my friend Heep,' said Mr.Micawber, 'who is a man of remarkable shrewdness, I desire to speak  with  allpossible respect. My friend Heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at  toohigh a figure, but he has made a great deal, in the way of extrication  from  thepressure of pecuniary difficulties, contingent on the value of my services; and onthe value of those services I pin my faith. Such address and intelligence as I chanceto possess,' said Mr. Micawber, boastfully disparaging himself, with the old genteelair, 'will be devoted to my friend Heep's service. I have already some acquaintancewith the law—as a defendant on civil process—and I shall immediately applymyself to the Commentaries of one of the most eminent and remarkable of  ourEnglish jurists. I believe it is unnecessary to add that I allude to Mr. justiceBlackstone.'\\nThese observations, and indeed the greater part of the observations made that\\nevening, were interrupted by Mrs. Micawber's discovering that Master  Micawberwas sitting on his boots, or holding his head on with both arms as if he felt it loose,or accidentally kicking Traddles under the table, or shuffling his feet over  oneanother, or producing them at distances from himself apparently outrageous tonature, or lying sideways with his hair among the wine-glasses, or developing hisrestlessness of limb in some other form incompatible with the general interests ofsociety; and by Master Micawber's receiving those discoveries in a resentful spirit.

Now, forexample, Mr. Traddles,' said Mrs. Micawber, assuming a profound air, 'a judge, oreven say a Chancellor.

Only a barrister is eligible  for\\nsuch preferments; and Mr. Micawber could not be a barrister, without beingentered at an inn of court as a student, for five years.'\\n'Do I follow you?' said Mrs. Micawber, with her most affable air of business. 'Do I\\nunderstand, my dear Mr. Traddles, that, at the expiration of that period, Mr.Micawber would be eligible as a Judge or Chancellor?'\\n'He would be ELIGIBLE,' returned Traddles, with a strong emphasis on that word.'Thank you,' said Mrs. Micawber.

I am persuaded, not only that this was quite the same to Mr. Micawber  aspaying the money, but that Traddles himself hardly knew the difference  until  hehad had time to think about it. Mr. Micawber walked so erect before  his  fellowman, on the strength of this virtuous action, that his chest looked half as  broadagain when he lighted us downstairs. We parted with great heartiness on both sides;and when I had seen Traddles to his own door, and was going home  alone,  Ithought, among the other odd and contradictory things I mused upon, that,  slipperyas Mr. Micawber was, I was probably indebted to some compassionate recollectionhe retained of me as his boy-lodger, for never having been asked by him formoney. I certainly should not have had the moral courage to refuse it; and I haveno doubt he knew that (to his credit be it written), quite as well as I did.\\nCHAPTER 37. A LITTLE COLD WATER\\nMy new life had lasted for more than a week, and I was stronger than ever in thosetremendous practical resolutions that I felt the crisis required. I continued to walkextremely fast, and to have a general idea that I was getting on. I made it a rule totake as much out of myself as I possibly could, in my way of doing everything towhich I applied my energies. I made a perfect victim of myself. I even entertainedsome idea of putting myself on a vegetable diet, vaguely conceiving that, inbecoming a graminivorous animal, I should sacrifice to Dora.\\nAs yet, little Dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness, otherwise than\\nas my letters darkly shadowed it forth. But another Saturday came, and on thatSaturday evening she was to be at Miss Mills's; and when Mr. Mills had gone tohis whist-club (telegraphed to me in the street, by a bird-cage in the drawing-roommiddle window), I was to go there to tea.\\nBy this time, we were quite settled down in Buckingham Street, where Mr. Dick\\ncontinued his copying in a state of absolute felicity. My aunt had obtained a signalvictory over Mrs. Crupp, by paying her off, throwing the first pitcher she plantedon the stairs out of window, and protecting in person, up and down the staircase, asupernumerary whom she engaged from the outer world. These vigorous measuresstruck such terror to the breast of Mrs. Crupp, that she subsided into her  ownkitchen, under the impression that my aunt was mad. My aunt being supremelyindifferent to Mrs. Crupp's opinion and everybody else's, and rather favouring thandiscouraging the idea, Mrs. Crupp, of late the bold, became within a few days sofaint-hearted, that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase, she  wouldendeavour to hide her portly form behind doors—leaving visible, however, a widemargin of flannel petticoat—or would shrink into dark corners. This gave my auntsuch unspeakable satisfaction, that I believe she took a delight in prowling up anddown, with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head, at times when Mrs.Crupp was likely to be in the way.\\nMy aunt, being uncommonly neat and ingenious, made so many little\\nimprovements in our domestic arrangements, that I seemed to be richer instead of\"),\n",

But the time had now come (Iam speaking of the Saturday when I was to take tea at Miss Mills's) when it wasnecessary for her to return home, and enter on the discharge of the duties she hadundertaken in behalf of Ham. 'So good-bye, Barkis,' said my aunt, 'and take care ofyourself! I am sure I never thought I could be sorry to lose you!'\\nI took Peggotty to the coach office and saw her off. She cried at  parting,  and\\nconfided her brother to my friendship as Ham had done.

Next to accepting a largesum on the spot, I believe this gave Peggotty more comfort than anything  I couldhave done.\\n'And, my dear!' whispered Peggotty, 'tell the pretty little angel that I should so have\\nliked to see her, only for a minute! And tell her that before she marries my boy, I'llcome and make your house so beautiful for you, if you'll let me!'\\nI declared that nobody else should touch it; and this gave Peggotty such delight that\\nshe went away in good spirits.\\nI fatigued myself as much as I possibly could in the Commons all day, by a variety\\nof devices, and at the appointed time in the evening repaired to Mr. Mills's street.Mr. Mills, who was a terrible fellow to fall asleep after dinner, had not yet goneout, and there was no bird-cage in the middle window.\\nHe kept me waiting so long, that I fervently hoped the Club would fine  him  for\\nbeing late. At last he came out; and then I saw my own Dora hang up the bird-cage, and peep into the balcony to look for me, and run in again when she saw Iwas there, while Jip remained behind, to bark injuriously at an immense butcher'sdog in the street, who could have taken him like a pill.\\nDora came to the drawing-room door to meet me; and Jip came scrambling out,\\ntumbling over his own growls, under the impression that I was a Bandit; and we allthree went in, as happy and loving as could be.

The changes that were rung upon dots, whichin such a position meant such a thing, and in such another position something else,entirely different; the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles; theunaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies' legs; thetremendous effects of a curve in a wrong place; not only troubled my  wakinghours, but reappeared before me in my sleep. When I had groped my way, blindly,through these difficulties, and had mastered the alphabet, which was an EgyptianTemple in itself, there then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrarycharacters; the most despotic characters I have ever known; who insisted,  forinstance, that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb, meant expectation, and that apen-and-ink sky-rocket, stood for disadvantageous. When I had fixed thesewretches in my mind, I found that they had driven everything else out of it; then,beginning again, I forgot them; while I was picking them up, I dropped the otherfragments of the system; in short, it was almost heart-breaking.\\nIt might have been quite heart-breaking, but for Dora, who was the stay and anchor\\nof my tempest-driven bark. Every scratch in the scheme was a gnarled oak in theforest of difficulty, and I went on cutting them down, one after another, with suchvigour, that in three or four months I was in a condition to make an experiment onone of our crack speakers in the Commons. Shall I ever forget how  the  crackspeaker walked off from me before I began, and left my imbecile pencil staggeringabout the paper as if it were in a fit!\\nThis would not do, it was quite clear. I was flying too high, and should never get\\non, so. I resorted to Traddles for advice; who suggested that he should  dictatespeeches to me, at a pace, and with occasional stoppages, adapted to my weakness.Very grateful for this friendly aid, I accepted the proposal; and night after night,almost every night, for a long time, we had a sort of Private Parliament inBuckingham Street, after I came home from the Doctor's.\\nI should like to see such a Parliament anywhere else! My aunt and Mr.  Dick\\nrepresented the Government or the Opposition (as the case might be), and Traddles,with the assistance of Enfield's Speakers, or a volume of  parliamentary  orations,thundered astonishing invectives against them. Standing by the table, with hisfinger in the page to keep the place, and his right arm flourishing above his head,Traddles, as Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord Castlereagh,Viscount Sidmouth, or Mr. Canning, would work himself into the most  violentheats, and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy andcorruption of my aunt and Mr. Dick; while I used to sit, at a little distance, withmy notebook on my knee, fagging after him with all my might and main. Theinconsistency and recklessness of Traddles were not to be exceeded by any  realpolitician. He was for any description of policy, in the compass of a  week;  and\"),\n",

My aunt, looking very\\nlike an immovable Chancellor of the Exchequer, would occasionally throw in an\\ninterruption or two, as 'Hear!' or 'No!' or 'Oh!' when the text  seemed to require it:which was always a signal to Mr. Dick (a perfect country gentleman) to  followlustily with the same cry. But Mr. Dick got taxed with such things in the course ofhis Parliamentary career, and was made responsible for such awful consequences,that he became uncomfortable in his mind sometimes. I believe he actually beganto be afraid he really had been doing something, tending to the annihilation of theBritish constitution, and the ruin of the country.\\nOften and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed  to midnight, and\\nthe candles were burning down. The result of so much good practice was, that  byand by I began to keep pace with Traddles pretty well, and should have been quitetriumphant if I had had the least idea what my notes were about.

It  was  very\\nhard, but I turned back, though with a heavy heart, and began laboriously andmethodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail's  pace;  stopping  toexamine minutely every speck in the way, on all sides, and making the mostdesperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever I met  them.  Iwas always punctual at the office; at the Doctor's too: and I really did work, as thecommon expression is, like a cart-horse. One day, when I went to the Commons asusual, I found Mr. Spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave, and talking tohimself. As he was in the habit of complaining of pains in his head—he hadnaturally a short throat, and I do seriously believe he over-starched himself—I wasat first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction; but he soonrelieved my uneasiness.\\nInstead of returning my 'Good morning' with his usual affability, he looked at me\\nin a distant, ceremonious manner, and coldly requested me to accompany him to acertain coffee-house, which, in those days, had a door opening into the Commons,just within the little archway in St. Paul's Churchyard. I complied, in a veryuncomfortable state, and with a warm shooting all over me, as if my apprehensionswere breaking out into buds. When I allowed him to go on a little before,  onaccount of the narrowness of the way, I observed that he carried his head with alofty air that was particularly unpromising; and my mind misgave me that  he hadfound out about my darling Dora.\\nIf I had not guessed this, on the way to the coffee-house, I could hardly have failed\\nto know what was the matter when I followed him into an upstairs room, and foundMiss Murdstone there, supported by a background of sideboard, on which wereseveral inverted tumblers sustaining lemons, and two of those extraordinary boxes,all corners and flutings, for sticking knives and forks in, which, happily formankind, are now obsolete.\\nMiss Murdstone gave me her chilly finger-nails, and sat severely rigid. Mr.\\nSpenlow shut the door, motioned me to a chair, and stood on the hearth-rug in frontof the fireplace.\\n'Have the goodness to show Mr. Copperfield,' said Mr. Spenlow, what you have in\\nyour reticule, Miss Murdstone.'\\nI believe it was the old identical steel-clasped reticule of my childhood, that shut up\"),\n",

'On the very day when I last saw him,' said I,\\n'he told me that he had, and that his affairs were long since settled.'\\nMr. jorkins and old Tiffey shook their heads with one accord.'That looks unpromising,' said Tiffey.'Very unpromising,' said Mr. jorkins.'Surely you don't doubt—' I began.'My good Mr. Copperfield!' said Tiffey, laying his hand upon my arm, and shutting\\nup both his eyes as he shook his head: 'if you had been in the Commons as long asI have, you would know that there is no subject on which men are so inconsistent,and so little to be trusted.'\\n'Why, bless my soul, he made that very remark!' I replied persistently.'I should call that almost final,' observed Tiffey. 'My opinion is—no will.'It appeared a wonderful thing to me, but it turned out that there was no will. He had\\nnever so much as thought of making one, so far as his papers afforded  anyevidence; for there was no kind of hint, sketch, or memorandum, of anytestamentary intention whatever. What was scarcely less astonishing to me, was,that his affairs were in a most disordered state. It was extremely difficult, I heard,to make out what he owed, or what he had paid, or of what he died possessed. Itwas considered likely that for years he could have had no clear opinion on thesesubjects himself. By little and little it came out, that, in the competition on allpoints of appearance and gentility then running high in the Commons, he had spentmore than his professional income, which was not a very large one, and hadreduced his private means, if they ever had been great (which was exceedinglydoubtful), to a very low ebb indeed. There was a sale of the furniture and lease, atNorwood; and Tiffey told me, little thinking how interested I was in the story, that,paying all the just debts of the deceased, and deducting his  share  of  outstandingbad and doubtful debts due to the firm, he wouldn't give a thousand pounds for allthe assets remaining.\"),\n",

WICKFIELD AND HEEP\\nMy aunt, beginning, I imagine, to be made seriously uncomfortable by myprolonged dejection, made a pretence of being anxious that I should go to Dover, tosee that all was working well at the cottage, which was let; and to  conclude  anagreement, with the same tenant, for a longer term of occupation. Janet was draftedinto the service of Mrs. Strong, where I saw her every day. She had beenundecided, on leaving Dover, whether or no to give the finishing touch  to  thatrenunciation of mankind in which she had been educated, by marrying a pilot; butshe decided against that venture. Not so much for the sake of principle, I believe, asbecause she happened not to like him.\\nAlthough it required an effort to leave Miss Mills, I fell rather willingly into my\\naunt\\'s pretence, as a means of enabling me to pass a few tranquil hours with Agnes.I consulted the good Doctor relative to an absence of three days; and the Doctorwishing me to take that relaxation,—he wished me to take more; but my energycould not bear that,—I made up my mind to go.\\nAs to the Commons, I had no great occasion to be particular about my duties in that\\nquarter. To say the truth, we were getting in no very good odour among the tip-topproctors, and were rapidly sliding down to but a doubtful position. The businesshad been indifferent under Mr. jorkins, before Mr. Spenlow\\'s time; and although ithad been quickened by the infusion of new blood, and by the display which Mr.Spenlow made, still it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to  bear,without being shaken, such a blow as the sudden loss of its active manager. It felloff very much. Mr. jorkins, notwithstanding his reputation in the firm, was an easy-going, incapable sort of man, whose reputation out of doors was not calculated toback it up. I was turned over to him now, and when I saw him take his snuff and letthe business go, I regretted my aunt\\'s thousand pounds more than ever.\\nBut this was not the worst of it. There were a number of hangers-on and outsiders'),\n",

Asour house now wanted business on any terms, we joined this noble band; and threwout lures to the hangers-on and outsiders, to bring their business to us. Marriagelicences and small probates were what we all looked for, and what paid us best;and the competition for these ran very high indeed. Kidnappers and inveiglers wereplanted in all the avenues of entrance to the Commons, with instructions to do theirutmost to cut off all persons in mourning, and all gentlemen with anything bashfulin their appearance, and entice them to the offices in which their respectiveemployers were interested; which instructions were so well observed, that I myself,before I was known by sight, was twice hustled into the premises of our principalopponent. The conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature toirritate their feelings, personal collisions took place; and the Commons was evenscandalized by our principal inveigler (who had formerly been in the wine trade,and afterwards in the sworn brokery line) walking about for some days with ablack eye. Any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an oldlady in black out of a vehicle, killing any proctor whom she inquired for,representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of thatproctor, and bearing the old lady off (sometimes greatly affected) to his employer'soffice. Many captives were brought to me in this way. As to marriage licences, thecompetition rose to such a pitch, that a shy gentleman in want of one, had nothingto do but submit himself to the first inveigler, or be fought for,  and  become  theprey of the strongest. One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, in the height ofthis contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might be ready to rush out and swearbefore a surrogate any victim who was brought in. The system of inveiglingcontinues, I believe, to this day. The last time I was in the Commons, a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway, andwhispering the word 'Marriage-licence' in my ear, was with great difficultyprevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor's. From thisdigression, let me proceed to Dover.\\nI found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage; and was enabled to gratify\\nmy aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant inherited her feud, and wagedincessant war against donkeys. Having settled the little business I had to transactthere, and slept there one night, I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning. Itwas now winter again; and the fresh, cold windy day, and the sweeping downland,brightened up my hopes a little.\\nComing into Canterbury, I loitered through the old streets with a sober pleasure that\\ncalmed my spirits, and eased my heart. There were the old signs, the old namesover the shops, the old people serving in them. It appeared so long,  since  I  hadbeen a schoolboy there, that I wondered the place was so little changed, until  Ireflected how little I was changed myself. Strange to say, that quiet influence whichwas inseparable in my mind from Agnes, seemed to pervade even the city  whereshe dwelt. The venerable cathedral towers, and the old jackdaws and rooks whoseairy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done; thebattered gateways, one stuck full with statues, long thrown down, and  crumbledaway, like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them; the still nooks,where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls; theancient houses, the pastoral landscape of field, orchard, and garden; everywhere—on everything—I felt the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful, softeningspirit.\"),\n",

Once she asked for a particular ballad,which she said her Ury (who was yawning in a great chair) doted on; and  atintervals she looked round at him, and reported to Agnes that he was in raptureswith the music. But she hardly ever spoke—I question if she ever  did—withoutmaking some mention of him. It was evident to me that this was the duty assignedto her.\\nThis lasted until bedtime. To have seen the mother and son, like two great  bats\\nhanging over the whole house, and darkening it with their ugly forms, made me souncomfortable, that I would rather have remained downstairs, knitting and all, thangone to bed. I hardly got any sleep. Next day the knitting and watching beganagain, and lasted all day.\\nI had not an opportunity of speaking to Agnes, for ten minutes. I could barely show\\nher my letter. I proposed to her to walk out with me; but Mrs.  Heep  repeatedlycomplaining that she was worse, Agnes charitably remained within, to bear hercompany. Towards the twilight I went out by myself, musing on what I ought todo, and whether I was justified in withholding from Agnes, any longer, what UriahHeep had told me in London; for that began to trouble me again, very much.\\nI had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town, upon the Ramsgate\\nroad, where there was a good path, when I was hailed, through the dust,  bysomebody behind me. The shambling figure, and the scanty great-coat, were not tobe mistaken. I stopped, and Uriah Heep came up.\\n'Well?' said I.'How fast you walk!' said he. 'My legs are pretty long, but you've given 'em quite a\\njob.'\\n'Where are you going?' said I.\"),\n",

They presented their complimentsto Mr. Copperfield, and informed him that they had given his letter their bestconsideration, 'with a view to the happiness of both parties'—which I thoughtrather an alarming expression, not only because of the use they had made of it inrelation to the family difference before-mentioned, but because I had (and have allmy life) observed that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks, easily let  off,and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colours not at all suggested by theiroriginal form. The Misses Spenlow added that they begged to forbear expressing,'through the medium of correspondence', an opinion on the subject of Mr.Copperfield's communication; but that if Mr. Copperfield would do them the favourto call, upon a certain day (accompanied, if he thought proper, by a confidentialfriend), they would be happy to hold some conversation on the subject.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'david-Cooper.pdf', 'page': 405}, page_content=\"To this favour, Mr. Copperfield immediately replied, with his respectful\\ncompliments, that he would have the honour of waiting on the Misses Spenlow, at\\nthe time appointed; accompanied, in accordance with their kind permission, by hisfriend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple. Having dispatched whichmissive, Mr. Copperfield fell into a condition of strong nervous agitation; and soremained until the day arrived.\\nIt was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved, at this eventful crisis,\\nof the inestimable services of Miss Mills. But Mr. Mills, who was always doingsomething or other to annoy me—or I felt as if he were, which was the same thing—had brought his conduct to a climax, by taking it into his head that he would goto India. Why should he go to India, except to harass me? To be sure he hadnothing to do with any other part of the world, and had a good deal to do with thatpart; being entirely in the India trade, whatever that was (I had floating dreamsmyself concerning golden shawls and elephants' teeth); having been at Calcutta inhis youth; and designing now to go out there again, in the capacity of residentpartner. But this was nothing to me. However, it was so much to him that for Indiahe was bound, and Julia with him; and Julia went into the country to take leave ofher relations; and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills, announcing that  itwas to be let or sold, and that the furniture (Mangle and all) was to be taken at avaluation. So, here was another earthquake of which I became the sport, before Ihad recovered from the shock of its predecessor!\\nI was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day; being divided\\nbetween my desire to appear to advantage, and my apprehensions of putting  onanything that might impair my severely practical character in the eyes of the MissesSpenlow. I endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes; myaunt approved the result; and Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles andme, for luck, as we went downstairs.\\nExcellent fellow as I knew Traddles to be, and warmly attached to him as I was, I\\ncould not help wishing, on that delicate occasion, that  he had never contracted thehabit of brushing his hair so very upright. It gave him a surprised look—not to saya hearth-broomy kind of expression—which, my apprehensions whispered, mightbe fatal to us.\\nI took the liberty of mentioning it to Traddles, as we were walking to Putney; and\\nsaying that if he WOULD smooth it down a little—\\n'My dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, lifting off his hat, and rubbing his hair  all\\nkinds of ways, 'nothing would give me greater pleasure. But it won't.'\\n'Won't be smoothed down?' said I.'No,' said Traddles. 'Nothing will induce it. If I was to carry a half-hundred-weight\\nupon it, all the way to Putney, it would be up again the moment the weight wastaken off. You have no idea what obstinate hair mine is, Copperfield. I am quite afretful porcupine.'\\nI was a little disappointed, I must confess, but thoroughly charmed by his good-\\nnature too. I told him how I esteemed his good-nature; and said that  his hair musthave taken all the obstinacy out of his character, for he had none.\\n'Oh!' returned Traddles, laughing. 'I assure you, it's quite an old story, my\\nunfortunate hair. My uncle's wife couldn't bear it. She said it exasperated  her.  Itstood very much in my way, too, when I first fell in love with Sophy. Very much!'\"),\n",

They pretend that\\nSophy has a lock of it in her desk, and is obliged to shut it in a clasped book, tokeep it down. We laugh about it.'\\n'By the by, my dear Traddles,' said I, 'your experience may suggest something to\\nme. When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned,did you make a regular proposal to her family? Was there anything like—what weare going through today, for instance?' I added, nervously.\\n'Why,' replied Traddles, on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen, 'it\\nwas rather a painful transaction, Copperfield, in my case. You see, Sophy being ofso much use in the family, none of them could endure the thought of her ever beingmarried. Indeed, they had quite settled among themselves that she never was to bemarried, and they called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, withthe greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler—'\\n'The mama?' said I.'The mama,' said Traddles—'Reverend Horace Crewler—when I mentioned it with\\nevery possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her was such that shegave a scream and became insensible. I couldn't approach the subject again,  formonths.'\\n'You did at last?' said I.'Well, the Reverend Horace did,' said Traddles. 'He is an excellent man, most\\nexemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought, as a Christian, toreconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it was so uncertain), and to bear nouncharitable feeling towards me. As to myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, Ifelt a perfect bird of prey towards the family.'\\n'The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?''Why, I can't say they did,' he returned. 'When we had  comparatively  reconciled\\nMrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You recollect my mentioning Sarah,as the one that has something the matter with her spine?'\\n'Perfectly!''She clenched both her hands,' said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;  'shut  her\\neyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and took nothing for two days buttoast-and-water, administered with a tea-spoon.'\\n'What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!' I remarked.'Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!' said Traddles. 'She is a very charming girl,\\nbut she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all have. Sophy told me afterwards,that the self-reproach she underwent while she was in attendance upon Sarah, nowords could describe. I know it must have been severe, by my own feelings,Copperfield; which were like a criminal's. After Sarah was restored, we still had tobreak it to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them  of  a  mostpathetic nature.

'The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject; and my unsettledprospects and indifferent circumstances are a great consolation to them. There willbe a deplorable scene, whenever we are married. It will be much more like  afuneral, than a wedding. And they'll all hate me for taking her away!'\\nHis honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his head,\\nimpresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality, for I was by thistime in a state of such excessive trepidation and wandering of mind, as to be quiteunable to fix my attention on anything. On our approaching the house where theMisses Spenlow lived, I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks andpresence of mind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glassof ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, heconducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow's door.\\nI had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid opened it; and\\nof wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass in it, into a quiet  littledrawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding a neat garden. Also of sittingdown here, on a sofa, and seeing Traddles's hair start up, now his hat was removed,like one of those obtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitioussnuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned clockticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time to the jerkingof my heart,—which it wouldn't. Also of looking round the room for any sign ofDora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that Jip once barked in the distance, andwas instantly choked by somebody. Ultimately I found myself backing Traddlesinto the fireplace, and bowing in great confusion to two dry little  elderly  ladies,dressed in black, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan ofthe late Mr. Spenlow.\\n'Pray,' said one of the two little ladies, 'be seated.'When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something which was\\nnot a cat—my first seat was—I so far recovered my sight, as to perceive that  Mr.Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the family; that  there was a disparityof six or eight years between the two sisters; and that the younger appeared to bethe manager of the conference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand—sofamiliar as it looked to me, and yet so odd!—and was referring to  it  through  aneye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with a  moreyouthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill, or tucker, or brooch,or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind, which made her look more lively. Theywere both upright in their carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sisterwho had not my letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and  resting  on eachother, like an Idol.\\n'Mr. Copperfield, I believe,' said the sister who had got my letter, addressing\\nherself to Traddles.\\nThis was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr. Copperfield,\\nand I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest themselves of  apreconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield, and altogether we were ina nice condition.

My private opinion is,that this was entirely a gratuitous assumption, and that Pidger was altogetherinnocent of any such sentiments—to which he had never given any sort ofexpression that I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had asuperstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he had not beencut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by swilling Bath water. They had a lurkingsuspicion even, that he died of secret love; though I must say there was a picture ofhim in the house with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to haveever preyed upon.\\n'We will not,' said Miss Lavinia, 'enter on the past history of this matter.

AndTraddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a Parliamentary Debate, really didcome out nobly: confirming me in good round terms, and in a plain sensiblepractical manner, that evidently made a favourable impression.\\n'I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little experience of such\\nthings,' said Traddles, 'being myself engaged to a young lady—one of ten, down inDevonshire—and seeing no probability, at present, of our engagement coming to atermination.'\\n'You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,' observed Miss\\nLavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, 'of the affection that is modest andretiring; that waits and waits?'\\n'Entirely, ma'am,' said Traddles.Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss Lavinia\\nlooked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh. 'Sister Lavinia,' saidMiss Clarissa, 'take my smelling-bottle.'\\nMiss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegar—Traddles and I\\nlooking on with great solicitude the while; and then went on to say, rather faintly:\\n'My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what course we\\nought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary likings, of such very youngpeople as your friend Mr. Copperfield and our niece.'\\n'Our brother Francis's child,' remarked Miss Clarissa. 'If our brother Francis's wife\\nhad found it convenient in her lifetime (though she had an unquestionable right toact as she thought best) to invite the family to her dinner-table, we might  haveknown our brother Francis's child better at the present moment. Sister  Lavinia,proceed.'\\nMiss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards herself, and\\nreferred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking notes she had made on thatpart of it.\\n'It seems to us,' said she, 'prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these feelings to the test\\nof our own observation. At present we know nothing of them, and are not in  a\"),\n",

We must guard ourselves  from  recognizingany positive engagement between Mr. Copperfield and our niece, until we  havehad an opportunity—'\\n'Until YOU have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia,' said Miss Clarissa.'Be it so,' assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh—'until I have had an opportunity of\\nobserving them.'\\n'Copperfield,' said Traddles, turning to me, 'you feel, I am sure, that nothing could\\nbe more reasonable or considerate.'\\n'Nothing!' cried I. 'I am deeply sensible of it.''In this position of affairs,' said Miss Lavinia, again referring to her notes, 'and\\nadmitting his visits on this understanding only, we must require from Mr.Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of honour, that no communication ofany kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge. Thatno project whatever shall be entertained with regard to our niece, without  beingfirst submitted to us—' 'To you, sister Lavinia,' Miss Clarissa interposed.\\n'Be it so, Clarissa!' assented Miss Lavinia resignedly—'to me—and receiving our\\nconcurrence. We must make this a most express and serious stipulation, not to bebroken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield to be accompanied by someconfidential friend today,' with an inclination of her head towards Traddles, whobowed, 'in order that there might be no doubt or misconception on this  subject. IfMr. Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving thispromise, I beg you to take time to consider it.'\\nI exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment's consideration\\ncould be necessary. I bound myself by the required promise, in a most impassionedmanner; called upon Traddles to witness it; and denounced myself as the mostatrocious of characters if I ever swerved from it in the least degree.\\n'Stay!' said Miss Lavinia, holding up her hand; 'we resolved, before we had  the\\npleasure of receiving you two gentlemen, to leave you alone for a quarter  of  anhour, to consider this point. You will allow us to retire.'\\nIt was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary. They persisted in\\nwithdrawing for the specified time. Accordingly, these little birds hopped out withgreat dignity; leaving me to receive the congratulations of Traddles, and to feel asif I were translated to regions of exquisite happiness. Exactly at the expiration ofthe quarter of an hour, they reappeared with no less dignity than they haddisappeared. They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made ofautumn-leaves: and they came rustling back, in like manner.\\nI then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions.'Sister Clarissa,' said Miss Lavinia, 'the rest is with you.'Miss Clarissa, unfolding her arms for the first time, took the notes and glanced at\"),\n",

My daily journeys to Highgate\\nconsidered, Putney was a long way off; and I naturally wanted to go there  as often\\nas I could. The proposed tea-drinkings being quite impracticable, I  compoundedwith Miss Lavinia for permission to visit every Saturday afternoon, withoutdetriment to my privileged Sundays. So, the close of every week was a delicioustime for me; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it.\\nI was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora's aunts rubbed  on, all\\nthings considered, much more smoothly than I could have expected. My aunt madeher promised visit within a few days of the conference; and within a few  moredays, Dora's aunts called upon her, in due state and form. Similar but more friendlyexchanges took place afterwards, usually at intervals of three or four weeks. I knowthat my aunt distressed Dora's aunts very much, by utterly setting at naught  thedignity of fly-conveyance, and walking out to Putney at extraordinary times, asshortly after breakfast or just before tea; likewise by wearing her bonnet  in  anymanner that happened to be comfortable to her head, without at all deferring to theprejudices of civilization on that subject. But Dora's aunts soon agreed to regard myaunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady, with a  strong understanding;and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora's aunts, byexpressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony, she loved me too wellnot to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony.\\nThe only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt himself  to\\ncircumstances, was Jip. He never saw my aunt without immediately displayingevery tooth in his head, retiring under a chair, and growling incessantly: with nowand then a doleful howl, as if she really were too much for his feelings. All kindsof treatment were tried with him, coaxing, scolding, slapping, bringing him toBuckingham Street (where he instantly dashed at the two cats, to the terror of allbeholders); but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt's society. Hewould sometimes think he had got the better of his objection, and be amiable for afew minutes; and then would put up his snub nose, and howl to that extent, thatthere was nothing for it but to blind him and put him in the  plate -warmer. Atlength, Dora regularly muffled him in a towel and shut him up there,  whenever myaunt was reported at the door.\\nOne thing troubled me much, after we had fallen into this quiet train. It was, that\\nDora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy or plaything. My aunt,with whom she gradually became familiar, always called her Little Blossom; andthe pleasure of Miss Lavinia's life was to wait upon her, curl her hair, makeornaments for her, and treat her like a pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sisterdid as a matter of course. It was very odd to me; but they all seemed to treat Dora,in her degree, much as Dora treated Jip in his.\\nI made up my mind to speak to Dora about this; and one day when we were out\\nwalking (for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia, after a while, to go out walking byourselves), I said to her that I wished she could get them to behave towards herdifferently.\\n'Because you know, my darling,' I remonstrated, 'you are not a child.''There!' said Dora. 'Now you're going to be cross!''Cross, my love?''I am sure they're very kind to me,' said Dora, 'and I am very happy—''Well!

As if I would—or could—be cruel to you, for the world!''Then don't find fault with me,' said Dora, making a rosebud of her mouth; 'and I'll\\nbe good.'\\nI was charmed by her presently asking me, of her own accord, to give her  that\\ncookery-book I had once spoken of, and to show her how to keep accounts as I hadonce promised I would. I brought the volume with me on my next visit (I got itprettily bound, first, to make it look less dry and more inviting); and as we strolledabout the Common, I showed her an old housekeeping-book of my aunt's, and gaveher a set of tablets, and a pretty little pencil-case and box of leads, to practisehousekeeping with.\\nBut the cookery-book made Dora's head ache, and the figures made her cry. They\\nwouldn't add up, she said. So she rubbed them out, and drew little nosegays andlikenesses of me and Jip, all over the tablets.\\nThen I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we walked about on\\na Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when we passed a butcher's shop, Iwould say:\\n'Now suppose, my pet, that we were married, and you were going to buy a shoulder\\nof mutton for dinner, would you know how to buy it?'\\nMy pretty little Dora's face would fall, and she would make her mouth into a bud\\nagain, as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss.\\n'Would you know how to buy it, my darling?' I would repeat, perhaps, if I were\\nvery inflexible.\\nDora would think a little, and then reply, perhaps, with great triumph:'Why, the butcher would know how to sell it, and what need I know? Oh, you silly\\nboy!'\\nSo, when I once asked Dora, with an eye to the cookery-book, what she would do,\\nif we were married, and I were to say I should like a nice Irish stew, she repliedthat she would tell the servant to make it; and then clapped her little hands togetheracross my arm, and laughed in such a charming manner that she was moredelightful than ever.\\nConsequently, the principal use to which the cookery-book was devoted, was being\\nput down in the corner for Jip to stand upon. But Dora was so pleased, when shehad trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off, and at the same timeto hold the pencil-case in his mouth, that I was very glad I had bought it.\\nAnd we fell back on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the songs about\\nnever leaving off dancing, Ta ra la! and were as happy as the week was long.

MISCHIEF\\nI feel as if it were not for me to record, even though this manuscript is intended forno eyes but mine, how hard I worked at that tremendous short-hand, and  allimprovement appertaining to it, in my sense of responsibility to Dora and her aunts.I will only add, to what I have already written of my perseverance at this time ofmy life, and of a patient and continuous energy which then began to be maturedwithin me, and which I know to be the strong part of my character, if it have anystrength at all, that there, on looking back, I find the source of my success. I havebeen very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have worked much harder, andnot succeeded half so well; but I never could have done what I have done, withoutthe habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination toconcentrate myself on one object at a time, no matter how quickly  its  successorshould come upon its heels, which I then formed. Heaven knows I write this, in nospirit of self-laudation. The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine,  in goingon here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man indeed, if he wouldbe spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected, many opportunitieswasted, many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast, anddefeating him. I do not hold one natural gift, I dare say, that I have not abused. Mymeaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all myheart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself tocompletely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly  inearnest. I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability canclaim immunity from the companionship of the steady, plain, hard-workingqualities, and hope to gain its end. There is no such thing as such fulfilment on thisearth. Some happy talent, and some fortunate opportunity, may form the two sidesof the ladder on which some men mount, but the rounds of that ladder  must  bemade of stuff to stand wear and tear; and there is no substitute for thorough-going,ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never to put one hand to anything, on which Icould throw my whole self; and never to affect depreciation of my work, whateverit was; I find, now, to have been my golden rules.\\nHow much of the practice I have just reduced to precept, I owe to Agnes, I will not\\nrepeat here.

Mr. Wickfield was the Doctor's\\nold friend, and the Doctor wished to talk with him, and do him  good. It  had beenmatter of conversation with Agnes when she was last in town, and this visit was theresult. She and her father came together. I was not much surprised to hear from herthat she had engaged to find a lodging in the neighbourhood for Mrs. Heep, whoserheumatic complaint required change of air, and who would be charmed to have itin such company.

At length her eyes were lifted up to  mine,and she stood on tiptoe to give me, more thoughtfully than usual, that precious littlekiss—once, twice, three times—and went out of the room.\\nThey all came back together within five minutes afterwards, and Dora's  unusual\\nthoughtfulness was quite gone then. She was laughingly resolved to put Jip throughthe whole of his performances, before the coach came. They took some time (notso much on account of their variety, as Jip's reluctance), and were still unfinishedwhen it was heard at the door. There was a hurried but affectionate parting betweenAgnes and herself; and Dora was to write to Agnes (who was not to mind herletters being foolish, she said), and Agnes was to write to Dora; and they had asecond parting at the coach door, and a third when Dora, in spite of theremonstrances of Miss Lavinia, would come running out once more to remindAgnes at the coach window about writing, and to shake her curls at me on the box.\\nThe stage-coach was to put us down near Covent Garden, where we were to take\\nanother stage-coach for Highgate. I was impatient for the short walk in the interval,that Agnes might praise Dora to me. Ah! what praise it was!  How  lovingly  andfervently did it commend the pretty creature I had won, with all  her artless gracesbest displayed, to my most gentle care! How thoughtfully remind me, yet with nopretence of doing so, of the trust in which I held the orphan child!\\nNever, never, had I loved Dora so deeply and truly, as I loved her that night. When\\nwe had again alighted, and were walking in the starlight along the quiet  road thatled to the Doctor's house, I told Agnes it was her doing.\\n'When you were sitting by her,' said I, 'you seemed to be no less her guardian angel\\nthan mine; and you seem so now, Agnes.'\\n'A poor angel,' she returned, 'but faithful.'\"),\n",

It  was  growing\\nlate. There was a light in the window of Mrs. Strong's chamber, and Agnes,pointing to it, bade me good night.\\n'Do not be troubled,' she said, giving me her hand, 'by our misfortunes and\\nanxieties. I can be happier in nothing than in your happiness. If you can ever giveme help, rely upon it I will ask you for it. God bless you always!'  In her beamingsmile, and in these last tones of her cheerful voice, I seemed again to see and hearmy little Dora in her company. I stood awhile, looking through the porch  at  thestars, with a heart full of love and gratitude, and then walked slowly forth. I hadengaged a bed at a decent alehouse close by, and was going out at the gate, when,happening to turn my head, I saw a light in the Doctor's study. A half-reproachfulfancy came into my mind, that he had been working at the Dictionary without myhelp. With the view of seeing if this were so, and, in any case, of bidding him goodnight, if he were yet sitting among his books, I turned back, and going softly acrossthe hall, and gently opening the door, looked in.\\nThe first person whom I saw, to my surprise, by the sober light of the shaded lamp,\\nwas Uriah. He was standing close beside it, with one of his skeleton hands over hismouth, and the other resting on the Doctor's table. The Doctor sat in his study chair,covering his face with his hands.

Mr. Micawber may have occasionally given a bill withoutconsulting me, or he may have misled me as to the period when  that  obligationwould become due. This has actually happened. But, in general, Mr. Micawber hashad no secrets from the bosom of affection—I allude to his wife—and hasinvariably, on our retirement to rest, recalled the events of the day.\\n'You will picture to yourself, my dear Mr. Copperfield, what the poignancy of my\\nfeelings must be, when I inform you that Mr. Micawber is entirely changed. He isreserved. He is secret. His life is a mystery to the partner of his joys and sorrows—I again allude to his wife—and if I should assure you that beyond knowing that it ispassed from morning to night at the office, I now know less of  it than I do of  theman in the south, connected with whose mouth the thoughtless children repeat anidle tale respecting cold plum porridge, I should adopt a popular fallacy to expressan actual fact.\\n'But this is not all. Mr. Micawber is morose. He is severe. He is estranged from our\\neldest son and daughter, he has no pride in his twins, he looks with an eye ofcoldness even on the unoffending stranger who last became a member of our circle.The pecuniary means of meeting our expenses, kept down to the utmost farthing,are obtained from him with great difficulty, and even under fearful threats that  hewill Settle himself (the exact expression); and he inexorably refuses to  give  anyexplanation whatever of this distracting policy.\\n'This is hard to bear. This is heart-breaking. If you will advise  me,  knowing my\\nfeeble powers such as they are, how you think it will be best to exert them in adilemma so unwonted, you will add another friendly obligation to the  many  youhave already rendered me. With loves from the children, and a smile from thehappily-unconscious stranger, I remain, dear Mr. Copperfield,\\n                              Your afflicted,\\n                                   'EMMA MICAWBER.'\\nI did not feel justified in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber's experience any other\\nrecommendation, than that she should try to reclaim Mr. Micawber by patience andkindness (as I knew she would in any case); but the letter set me thinking abouthim very much.\"),\n",

Let me stand aside,\\nto see the phantoms of those days go by me, accompanying the shadow of myself,in dim procession.\\nWeeks, months, seasons, pass along. They seem little more than a summer day and\\na winter evening. Now, the Common where I walk with Dora is all  in  bloom,  afield of bright gold; and now the unseen heather lies in mounds and bunchesunderneath a covering of snow. In a breath, the river that flows through our Sundaywalks is sparkling in the summer sun, is ruffled by the winter wind, or  thickenedwith drifting heaps of ice. Faster than ever river ran towards the sea, it  flashes,darkens, and rolls away.\\nNot a thread changes, in the house of the two little bird-like ladies. The clock ticks\\nover the fireplace, the weather-glass hangs in the hall. Neither clock nor weather-glass is ever right; but we believe in both, devoutly.\\nI have come legally to man's estate. I have attained the dignity of twenty-one. But\\nthis is a sort of dignity that may be thrust upon one. Let me think  what  I  haveachieved.\\nI have tamed that savage stenographic mystery. I make a respectable income by it. I\\nam in high repute for my accomplishment in all pertaining to the art, and am joinedwith eleven others in reporting the debates in Parliament for a Morning Newspaper.Night after night, I record predictions that never come to pass, professions that arenever fulfilled, explanations that are only meant to mystify. I wallow in words.Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed fowl:skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and foot with redtape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth of political life. I amquite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted.\\nMy dear old Traddles has tried his hand at the same pursuit, but it is not in\\nTraddles's way. He is perfectly good-humoured respecting his failure, and remindsme that he always did consider himself slow. He has occasional employment on thesame newspaper, in getting up the facts of dry subjects, to be  written  about  andembellished by more fertile minds. He is called to the bar; and with admirableindustry and self-denial has scraped another hundred pounds together, to fee  aConveyancer whose chambers he attends. A great deal of very hot port wine wasconsumed at his call; and, considering the figure, I should think the Inner Templemust have made a profit by it.\\nI have come out in another way. I have taken with fear and trembling to authorship.\\nI wrote a little something, in secret, and sent it to a magazine, and it was publishedin the magazine. Since then, I have taken heart to write a good many trifling pieces.Now, I am regularly paid for them. Altogether, I am well off, when I  tell  myincome on the fingers of my left hand, I pass the third finger and take in the fourthto the middle joint.\\nWe have removed, from Buckingham Street, to a pleasant little cottage very near\\nthe one I looked at, when my enthusiasm first came on.

It would be better for them  to buy the  goods at once,without this ceremony of inspection; for, when we go to see a kitchen fender andmeat-screen, Dora sees a Chinese house for Jip, with little bells on the  top,  andprefers that. And it takes a long time to accustom Jip to his new residence, after wehave bought it; whenever he goes in or out, he makes all the little bells ring, and ishorribly frightened.\\nPeggotty comes up to make herself useful, and falls to work immediately.  Her\\ndepartment appears to be, to clean everything over and over again. She rubseverything that can be rubbed, until it shines, like her own honest forehead, withperpetual friction.

I am going to  take  out  thelicence.\\nIt is a little document to do so much; and Traddles contemplates it, as it lies upon\\nmy desk, half in admiration, half in awe. There are the names, in the  sweet  oldvisionary connexion, David Copperfield and Dora Spenlow; and there, in thecorner, is that Parental Institution, the Stamp Office, which is so benignantlyinterested in the various transactions of human life, looking down upon our Union;and there is the Archbishop of Canterbury invoking a blessing on us  in print, anddoing it as cheap as could possibly be expected.\\nNevertheless, I am in a dream, a flustered, happy, hurried dream.  I  can't  believe\\nthat it is going to be; and yet I can't believe but that  everyone I pass in the street,must have some kind of perception, that I am to be married the day after tomorrow.The Surrogate knows me, when I go down to be sworn; and disposes of me easily,as if there were a Masonic understanding between us. Traddles is not at all wanted,but is in attendance as my general backer.\\n'I hope the next time you come here, my dear fellow,' I say to Traddles, 'it will be\\non the same errand for yourself.

Agnes has a great liking for Traddles, and itis capital to see them meet, and to observe the glory of Traddles as he commendsthe dearest girl in the world to her acquaintance.\\nStill I don't believe it. We have a delightful evening, and are supremely happy; but\\nI don't believe it yet. I can't collect myself. I can't check off  my  happiness  as  ittakes place. I feel in a misty and unsettled kind of state; as if I had got up veryearly in the morning a week or two ago, and had never been to bed since. I can'tmake out when yesterday was. I seem to have been carrying the licence about, inmy pocket, many months.\\nNext day, too, when we all go in a flock to see the house—our house—Dora's and\\nmine—I am quite unable to regard myself as its master. I seem to be there,  bypermission of somebody else. I half expect the real master to come home presently,and say he is glad to see me. Such a beautiful little house as it is, with everythingso bright and new; with the flowers on the carpets looking as if freshly gathered,and the green leaves on the paper as if they had just come out; with the spotlessmuslin curtains, and the blushing rose-coloured furniture, and Dora's garden hatwith the blue ribbon—do I remember, now, how I loved her in such another hatwhen I first knew her!—already hanging on its little peg; the guitar-case quite  athome on its heels in a corner; and everybody tumbling over Jip's pagoda, which ismuch too big for the establishment. Another happy evening, quite as unreal as allthe rest of it, and I steal into the usual room before going away. Dora is not there. Isuppose they have not done trying on yet. Miss Lavinia peeps in, and tells memysteriously that she will not be long. She is rather long, notwithstanding; but byand by I hear a rustling at the door, and someone taps.\\nI say, 'Come in!' but someone taps again.I go to the door, wondering who it is; there, I meet a pair of bright eyes, and a\\nblushing face; they are Dora's eyes and face, and Miss Lavinia has dressed her intomorrow's dress, bonnet and all, for me to see.

So Dora stands in a delightful state of confusion for aminute or two, to be admired; and then takes off her bonnet—looking so naturalwithout it!—and runs away with it in her hand; and comes dancing down again inher own familiar dress, and asks Jip if I have got a beautiful little wife, andwhether he'll forgive her for being married, and kneels down to  make  him  standupon the cookery-book, for the last time in her single life.\\nI go home, more incredulous than ever, to a lodging that I have hard by; and get up\\nvery early in the morning, to ride to the Highgate road and fetch my aunt.\\nI have never seen my aunt in such state.

OUR HOUSEKEEPING\\nIt was a strange condition of things, the honeymoon being over, and thebridesmaids gone home, when I found myself sitting down in my own small housewith Dora; quite thrown out of employment, as I may say, in respect of  thedelicious old occupation of making love.\\nIt seemed such an extraordinary thing to have Dora always there. It was so\\nunaccountable not to be obliged to go out to see her, not to have any occasion to betormenting myself about her, not to have to write to her, not to be scheming anddevising opportunities of being alone with her. Sometimes of an evening, when Ilooked up from my writing, and saw her seated opposite, I would lean back in mychair, and think how queer it was that there we were, alone together as a matter ofcourse—nobody's business any more—all the romance of our engagement putaway upon a shelf, to rust—no one to please but one another—one another  toplease, for life.\\nWhen there was a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so strange to me,\\nas I was walking home, to think that Dora was at home! It was such a wonderfulthing, at first, to have her coming softly down to talk to me as I ate my supper. Itwas such a stupendous thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers. Itwas altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it!\\nI doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house, than\\nI and my pretty Dora did. We had a servant, of course. She kept house for us. Ihave still a latent belief that she must have been Mrs. Crupp's daughter in disguise,we had such an awful time of it with Mary Anne.\\nHer name was Paragon. Her nature was represented to us, when we engaged her, as\\nbeing feebly expressed in her name.

His shell-jacket was as much too little for him as he wastoo big for the premises. He made the cottage smaller than it need have been, bybeing so very much out of proportion to it.

If I judged harshly of otherpeople's mistakes in marriage, it may have been because I had bitter reason to judgeharshly of my own. Let that pass. I have been a grumpy, frumpy, wayward sort ofa woman, a good many years. I am still, and I always shall be.

Our appearance in a\\nshop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought out immediately. If  webought a lobster, it was full of water. All our meat turned out to be tough, and therewas hardly any crust to our loaves. In search of the principle on which joints oughtto be roasted, to be roasted enough, and not too much, I myself referred  to  theCookery Book, and found it there established as the allowance of a quarter of anhour to every pound, and say a quarter over. But the principle always failed us bysome curious fatality, and we never could hit any medium between redness  andcinders.\\nI had reason to believe that in accomplishing these failures we incurred a far\\ngreater expense than if we had achieved a series of triumphs. It appeared to me, onlooking over the tradesmen's books, as if we might have kept the basement storeypaved with butter, such was the extensive scale of our consumption of that article. Idon't know whether the Excise returns of the period may have exhibited  anyincrease in the demand for pepper; but if our performances did not affect themarket, I should say several families must have left off using it. And the mostwonderful fact of all was, that we never had anything in the house.\\nAs to the washerwoman pawning the clothes, and coming in a state of  penitent\\nintoxication to apologize, I suppose that might have happened several times  toanybody. Also the chimney on fire, the parish engine, and perjury on the part of theBeadle. But I apprehend that we were personally fortunate in engaging a servantwith a taste for cordials, who swelled our running account for porter at the public-house by such inexplicable items as 'quartern rum shrub (Mrs. C.)'; 'Half-quarterngin and cloves (Mrs. C.)'; 'Glass rum and peppermint (Mrs. C.)'—the parenthesesalways referring to Dora, who was supposed, it appeared on explanation, to haveimbibed the whole of these refreshments.\\nOne of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little dinner to Traddles. I met\\nhim in town, and asked him to walk out with me that afternoon. He  readilyconsenting, I wrote to Dora, saying I would bring him home. It was pleasantweather, and on the road we made my domestic happiness the theme ofconversation. Traddles was very full of it; and said, that, picturing himself withsuch a home, and Sophy waiting and preparing for him, he could think of nothingwanting to complete his bliss.\\nI could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the opposite end of the table, but\\nI certainly could have wished, when we sat down, for a little more room. I did notknow how it was, but though there were only two of us, we were at once alwayscramped for room, and yet had always room enough to lose everything in. I suspectit may have been because nothing had a place of its own, except Jip's pagoda,which invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare. On the present occasion,Traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda and the guitar-case, and Dora's flower-painting, and my writing-table, that I had serious doubts of the possibility of hisusing his knife and fork; but he protested, with his own good-humour, 'Oceans ofroom, Copperfield!

For similar reasonsI made no allusion to the skirmishing plates upon the floor; or to the disreputableappearance of the castors, which were all at sixes and sevens, and looked drunk; orto the further blockade of Traddles by wandering vegetable dishes and jugs. I couldnot help wondering in my own mind, as I contemplated the boiled leg of muttonbefore me, previous to carving it, how it came to pass that our joints of meat wereof such extraordinary shapes—and whether our butcher contracted for all thedeformed sheep that came into the world; but I kept my reflections to myself.\\n'My love,' said I to Dora, 'what have you got in that dish?'I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at me, as if\\nshe wanted to kiss me.\\n'Oysters, dear,' said Dora, timidly.'Was that YOUR thought?' said I, delighted.'Ye-yes, Doady,' said Dora.'There never was a happier one!' I exclaimed, laying down the carving-knife and\\nfork. 'There is nothing Traddles likes so much!'\\n'Ye-yes, Doady,' said Dora, 'and so I bought a beautiful little barrel of them,  and\\nthe man said they were very good.

At least  weate as much of it as was done, and made up with capers.

This would occasion a diversion in Jip'sfavour, and some inking of his nose, perhaps, as a penalty. Then she would tell Jipto lie down on the table instantly, 'like a lion'—which was one of his tricks, thoughI cannot say the likeness was striking—and, if he were in an obedient humour, hewould obey. Then she would take up a pen, and begin to write, and find a hair in it.Then she would take up another pen, and begin to write, and find that it spluttered.Then she would take up another pen, and begin to write, and say in a low voice,'Oh, it's a talking pen, and will disturb Doady!'

It would avail me nothing to extenuate it now.\\nThus it was that I took upon myself the toils and cares of our life, and had  no\\npartner in them. We lived much as before, in reference to our scrambling householdarrangements; but I had got used to those, and Dora I was pleased to see wasseldom vexed now. She was bright and cheerful in the old childish way, loved medearly, and was happy with her old trifles.\\nWhen the debates were heavy—I mean as to length, not quality, for in the last\\nrespect they were not often otherwise—and I went home late, Dora would neverrest when she heard my footsteps, but would always come downstairs to meet me.When my evenings were unoccupied by the pursuit for which I had qualifiedmyself with so much pains, and I was engaged in writing at home, she would sitquietly near me, however late the hour, and be so mute, that I would often thinkshe had dropped asleep.

I seldom foundthat the places to which they belonged were locked, or that they were of any useexcept as a plaything for Jip—but Dora was pleased, and that pleased me.

It was autumn, when there were no debates to vex theevening air; and I remember how the leaves smelt like our garden at Blunderstoneas we trod them under foot, and how the old, unhappy feeling, seemed to go by, onthe sighing wind.\\nIt was twilight when we reached the cottage.

And that there is not a chair in this house, in which a paper can bewhat I call, read, except one in the Study. This took me to the Study, where I saw alight. I opened the door. In company with the dear Doctor were two professionalpeople, evidently connected with the law, and they were all three standing at thetable: the darling Doctor pen in hand. \"This simply expresses then,\" said the Doctor—Annie, my love, attend to the very words—\"this simply expresses then,gentlemen, the confidence I have in Mrs. Strong, and gives her all unconditionally?\" One of the professional people replied, \"And gives her all unconditionally.\" Uponthat, with the natural feelings of a mother, I said, \"Good God, I beg your pardon!\"fell over the door-step, and came away through the little back passage where thepantry is.\\'\\nMrs. Strong opened the window, and went out into the verandah, where she stood\\nleaning against a pillar.'),\n",

There was a covered way across a little paved court, to an entrancethat was never used; and there was one round staircase window, at odds with all therest, and the only one unshaded by a blind, which had the same unoccupied blanklook.

I was not long in recollecting Mrs. Steerforth's little\\nparlour-maid, who had formerly worn blue ribbons in her cap. She had taken themout now, to adapt herself, I suppose, to the altered character of the house; and worebut one or two disconsolate bows of sober brown.\\n'If you please, sir, would you have the goodness to walk in, and speak to  Miss\\nDartle?'\\n'Has Miss Dartle sent you for me?' I inquired.'Not tonight, sir, but it's just the same. Miss Dartle saw you pass a night or two ago;\\nand I was to sit at work on the staircase, and when I saw you pass again, to ask youto step in and speak to her.'\\nI turned back, and inquired of my conductor, as we went along, how Mrs.\\nSteerforth was. She said her lady was but poorly, and kept her own room a gooddeal.\\nWhen we arrived at the house, I was directed to Miss Dartle in the garden, and left\\nto make my presence known to her myself. She was sitting on a seat at one end ofa kind of terrace, overlooking the great city. It was a sombre evening, with a luridlight in the sky; and as I saw the prospect scowling in the distance, with here andthere some larger object starting up into the sullen glare, I fancied it was no inaptcompanion to the memory of this fierce woman.\\nShe saw me as I advanced, and rose for a moment to receive me. I thought her,\\nthen, still more colourless and thin than when I had seen her last; the flashing eyesstill brighter, and the scar still plainer.\\nOur meeting was not cordial. We had parted angrily on the last occasion; and there\\nwas an air of disdain about her, which she took no pains to conceal.\\n'I am told you wish to speak to me, Miss Dartle,' said I, standing near her, with my\"),\n",

'Pray has this girl been found?'\\n'No.''And yet she has run away!'I saw her thin lips working while she looked at me, as if they were eager to load\\nher with reproaches.\\n'Run away?' I repeated.'Yes! From him,' she said, with a laugh. 'If she is not found, perhaps she never will\\nbe found. She may be dead!'\\nThe vaunting cruelty with which she met my glance, I never saw expressed in any\\nother face that ever I have seen.\\n'To wish her dead,' said I, 'may be the kindest wish that one of her own sex could\\nbestow upon her.

Do you wish to know what isknown of her?'\\n'Yes,' said I.She rose with an ill-favoured smile, and taking a few steps towards a wall of holly\\nthat was near at hand, dividing the lawn from a kitchen-garden, said, in a loudervoice, 'Come here!'—as if she were calling to some unclean beast.\\n'You will restrain any demonstrative championship or vengeance in this place, of\\ncourse, Mr. Copperfield?' said she, looking over her shoulder at me with the sameexpression.\\nI inclined my head, without knowing what she meant; and she said, 'Come here!'\\nagain; and returned, followed by the respectable Mr. Littimer, who, withundiminished respectability, made me a bow, and took up his position behind her.The air of wicked grace: of triumph, in which, strange to say, there was yetsomething feminine and alluring: with which she reclined upon the seat betweenus, and looked at me, was worthy of a cruel Princess in a Legend.\\n'Now,' said she, imperiously, without glancing at him, and touching the old wound\\nas it throbbed: perhaps, in this instance, with pleasure rather than pain. 'Tell Mr.Copperfield about the flight.'\\n'Mr. James and myself, ma'am—''Don't address yourself to me!' she interrupted with a frown.'Mr. James and myself, sir—''Nor to me, if you please,' said I.Mr. Littimer, without being at all discomposed, signified by a slight obeisance, that\\nanything that was most agreeable to us was most agreeable to him; and began\"),\n",

In another, the ground was cumbered with rustyiron monsters of steam-boilers, wheels, cranks, pipes, furnaces, paddles, anchors,diving-bells, windmill-sails, and I know not what strange objects, accumulated bysome speculator, and grovelling in the dust, underneath which—having sunk intothe soil of their own weight in wet weather—they had the appearance  of  vainlytrying to hide themselves. The clash and glare of sundry fiery Works upon theriver-side, arose by night to disturb everything except the heavy and  unbrokensmoke that poured out of their chimneys. Slimy gaps and causeways, windingamong old wooden piles, with a sickly substance clinging to the latter, like  greenhair, and the rags of last year's handbills offering rewards for drowned menfluttering above high-water mark, led down through the ooze and slush to the ebb-tide. There was a story that one of the pits dug for the dead in the time of the GreatPlague was hereabout; and a blighting influence seemed to have proceeded from itover the whole place. Or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into thatnightmare condition, out of the overflowings of the polluted stream.\\nAs if she were a part of the refuse it had cast out, and left to corruption and decay,\\nthe girl we had followed strayed down to the river's brink, and stood in the midst ofthis night-picture, lonely and still, looking at the water.\\nThere were some boats and barges astrand in the mud, and these enabled us  to\\ncome within a few yards of her without being seen. I then signed to Mr. Peggotty toremain where he was, and emerged from their shade to speak to her. I did  notapproach her solitary figure without trembling; for this gloomy end to herdetermined walk, and the way in which she stood, almost within the cavernousshadow of the iron bridge, looking at the lights crookedly reflected  in  the  strongtide, inspired a dread within me.\\nI think she was talking to herself. I am sure, although absorbed in  gazing  at  the\\nwater, that her shawl was off her shoulders, and that she was muffling her hands init, in an unsettled and bewildered way, more like the action of a sleep-walker thana waking person. I know, and never can forget, that there was that in her wildmanner which gave me no assurance but that she would sink before my eyes, until Ihad her arm within my grasp.\\nAt the same moment I said 'Martha!'She uttered a terrified scream, and struggled with me with such strength that I\\ndoubt if I could have held her alone. But a stronger hand than mine was laid uponher; and when she raised her frightened eyes and saw whose it was, she made butone more effort and dropped down between us. We carried her away from thewater to where there were some dry stones, and there laid her down, crying andmoaning. In a little while she sat among the stones, holding her wretched head withboth her hands.\"),\n",

For  thisreason, I retained my modesty in very self-respect; and the more praise I got, themore I tried to deserve.\\nIt is not my purpose, in this record, though in all other essentials it is my written\\nmemory, to pursue the history of my own fictions.

We wanted to getrid of him, but he was very much attached to us, and wouldn't go.

But he was very penitent indeed, and in a peculiar way—not in the lump, but by instalments. For example: the day after that on which I wasobliged to appear against him, he made certain revelations touching a hamper in thecellar, which we believed to be full of wine, but which had nothing in it exceptbottles and corks. We supposed he had now eased his mind, and told the worst heknew of the cook; but, a day or two afterwards, his conscience  sustained  a  newtwinge, and he disclosed how she had a little girl, who, early every morning, tookaway our bread; and also how he himself had been suborned to maintain themilkman in coals. In two or three days more, I was informed by the  authorities ofhis having led to the discovery of sirloins of beef among the kitchen -stuff, andsheets in the rag-bag. A little while afterwards, he broke out in  an  entirely  newdirection, and confessed to a knowledge of burglarious intentions as to ourpremises, on the part of the pot-boy, who was immediately taken up. I got to be soashamed of being such a victim, that I would have given him any money to holdhis tongue, or would have offered a round bribe for his being permitted to runaway.

We are bound to think of that. I can't help thinking of it, Dora. It\\nis a reflection I am unable to dismiss, and it sometimes makes  me  very  uneasy.There, dear, that's all. Come now. Don't be foolish!'\\nDora would not allow me, for a long time, to remove the handkerchief. She sat\\nsobbing and murmuring behind it, that, if I was uneasy, why had I ever  beenmarried? Why hadn't I said, even the day before we went to church, that I knew Ishould be uneasy, and I would rather not? If I couldn't bear her, why didn't I sendher away to her aunts at Putney, or to Julia Mills in India? Julia would be glad tosee her, and would not call her a transported page; Julia never had called  heranything of the sort. In short, Dora was so afflicted, and so afflicted me by being inthat condition, that I felt it was of no use repeating this kind of effort, though neverso mildly, and I must take some other course.\\nWhat other course was left to take? To 'form her mind'? This was a common phrase\\nof words which had a fair and promising sound, and I resolved to form  Dora'smind.\\nI began immediately. When Dora was very childish, and I would have  infinitely\\npreferred to humour her, I tried to be grave—and disconcerted her, and myself too.I talked to her on the subjects which occupied my thoughts; and I read Shakespeareto her—and fatigued her to the last degree. I accustomed myself to giving her, as itwere quite casually, little scraps of useful information, or sound opinion—and shestarted from them when I let them off, as if they had been crackers. No matter howincidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little wife's mind, I could nothelp seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about, andbecame a prey to the keenest apprehensions. In particular, it was clear to me, thatshe thought Shakespeare a terrible fellow. The formation went on very slowly.\\nI pressed Traddles into the service without his knowledge; and whenever he came\\nto see us, exploded my mines upon him for the edification of Dora at second hand.The amount of practical wisdom I bestowed upon Traddles in this manner wasimmense, and of the best quality; but it had no other effect upon Dora than todepress her spirits, and make her always nervous with the dread that it would beher turn next. I found myself in the condition of a schoolmaster, a trap, a pitfall; ofalways playing spider to Dora's fly, and always pouncing out of my  hole  to  herinfinite disturbance.\\nStill, looking forward through this intermediate stage, to the time when there should\\nbe a perfect sympathy between Dora and me, and when I should have 'formed hermind' to my entire satisfaction, I persevered, even for months. Finding at  last,however, that, although I had been all this time a very porcupine or hedgehog,bristling all over with determination, I had effected nothing, it began to occur to methat perhaps Dora's mind was already formed.\\nOn further consideration this appeared so likely, that I abandoned my scheme,\\nwhich had had a more promising appearance in words than in action; resolvinghenceforth to be satisfied with my child-wife, and to try to change her into nothingelse by any process. I was heartily tired of being sagacious and prudent by myself,and of seeing my darling under restraint; so I bought a pretty pair of ear-rings forher, and a collar for Jip, and went home one day to make myself agreeable.\\nDora was delighted with the little presents, and kissed me joyfully; but there was a\\nshadow between us, however slight, and I had made up my mind that it should notbe there.

For she made no effort to proceed.'Nothing!' said Dora.'Nothing?'

'Is that  the question? Yes,indeed, I do.'\\n'Is that what you have been trying?' cried Dora. 'Oh what a shocking boy!''But I shall never try any more,' said I. 'For I love her dearly as she is.''Without a story—really?' inquired Dora, creeping closer to me.'Why should I seek to change,' said I, 'what has been so precious to me for so long!\\nYou never can show better than as your own natural self, my sweet Dora; and we'lltry no conceited experiments, but go back to our old way, and be happy.'\\n'And be happy!' returned Dora.

'We must do the best we can.''And you won't tell me, any more, that we make other people bad,' coaxed Dora;\\n'will you?

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'david-Cooper.pdf', 'page': 479}, page_content=\"So ended my last attempt to make any change in Dora. I had been unhappy  in\\ntrying it; I could not endure my own solitary wisdom; I could not reconcile it with\\nher former appeal to me as my child-wife. I resolved to do what I could, in a quietway, to improve our proceedings myself, but I foresaw that my utmost would bevery little, or I must degenerate into the spider again, and be for ever lying in wait.\\nAnd the shadow I have mentioned, that was not to be between us any more, but\\nwas to rest wholly on my own heart? How did that fall?\\nThe old unhappy feeling pervaded my life. It was deepened, if it were changed at\\nall; but it was as undefined as ever, and addressed me like a strain of sorrowfulmusic faintly heard in the night. I loved my wife dearly, and I was happy; but thehappiness I had vaguely anticipated, once, was not the happiness I  enjoyed,  andthere was always something wanting.\\nIn fulfilment of the compact I have made with myself, to reflect my mind on this\\npaper, I again examine it, closely, and bring its secrets to the light. What I missed,I still regarded—I always regarded—as something that had been a dream  of  myyouthful fancy; that was incapable of realization; that I was now discovering to beso, with some natural pain, as all men did. But that it would have  been better forme if my wife could have helped me more, and shared the many thoughts in whichI had no partner; and that this might have been; I knew.\\nBetween these two irreconcilable conclusions: the one, that what I felt was general\\nand unavoidable; the other, that it was particular to me, and might have beendifferent: I balanced curiously, with no distinct sense of their opposition  to  eachother. When I thought of the airy dreams of youth that are incapable of realization,I thought of the better state preceding manhood that I had outgrown; and then thecontented days with Agnes, in the dear old house, arose before me, like spectres ofthe dead, that might have some renewal in another world, but never more could bereanimated here.\\nSometimes, the speculation came into my thoughts, What might have happened, or\\nwhat would have happened, if Dora and I had never known each other? But shewas so incorporated with my existence, that it was the idlest of all fancies,  andwould soon rise out of my reach and sight, like gossamer floating in the air.\\nI always loved her. What I am describing, slumbered, and half awoke, and slept\\nagain, in the innermost recesses of my mind. There was no evidence of it in me; Iknow of no influence it had in anything I said or did. I bore the weight of all  ourlittle cares, and all my projects; Dora held the pens; and we both felt that our shareswere adjusted as the case required. She was truly fond of me, and proud of me; andwhen Agnes wrote a few earnest words in her letters to Dora, of the pride  andinterest with which my old friends heard of my growing reputation, and read mybook as if they heard me speaking its contents, Dora read them out to me with tearsof joy in her bright eyes, and said I was a dear old clever, famous boy.\\n'The first mistaken impulse of an undisciplined heart.' Those words of Mrs. Strong's\\nwere constantly recurring to me, at this time; were almost always  present  to  mymind. I awoke with them, often, in the night; I remember to have even read them,in dreams, inscribed upon the walls of houses. For I knew, now, that my own heartwas undisciplined when it first loved Dora; and that if it had been disciplined, itnever could have felt, when we were married, what it had felt in its secretexperience.\\n'There can be no disparity in marriage, like unsuitability of mind and purpose.'\"),\n",

This was the discipline to which I tried to bring my heart, when I beganto think. It made my second year much happier than my first; and, what was betterstill, made Dora's life all sunshine.\\nBut, as that year wore on, Dora was not strong. I had hoped that lighter hands than\\nmine would help to mould her character, and that a baby-smile upon her  breastmight change my child-wife to a woman. It was not to be.

'He must have a piece of flannel in his house this winter,and I shouldn't wonder if he came out quite fresh again, with the  flowers  in  thespring. Bless the little dog!' exclaimed my aunt, 'if he had as many lives as a cat,and was on the point of losing 'em all, he'd bark at me with his  last  breath,  Ibelieve!'\\nDora had helped him up on the sofa; where he really was defying my aunt to such a\\nfurious extent, that he couldn't keep straight, but barked himself sideways.  Themore my aunt looked at him, the more he reproached her; for she had lately takento spectacles, and for some inscrutable reason he considered the glasses personal.\\nDora made him lie down by her, with a good deal of persuasion; and when he was\\nquiet, drew one of his long ears through and through her hand, repeatingthoughtfully, 'Even little Jip! Oh, poor fellow!'\\n'His lungs are good enough,' said my aunt, gaily, 'and his dislikes are not at  all\\nfeeble. He has a good many years before him, no doubt.

But they said, wait a fewdays more; and then, wait a few days more; and still she neither ran nor walked.She looked very pretty, and was very merry; but the little feet that used to be sonimble when they danced round Jip, were dull and motionless.\\nI began to carry her downstairs every morning, and upstairs every night. She would\\nclasp me round the neck and laugh, the while, as if I did it for a wager. Jip wouldbark and caper round us, and go on before, and look back on the landing, breathingshort, to see that we were coming. My aunt, the best and most cheerful of nurses,would trudge after us, a moving mass of shawls and pillows. Mr. Dick would nothave relinquished his post of candle-bearer to anyone alive. Traddles would beoften at the bottom of the staircase, looking on, and taking charge of  sportivemessages from Dora to the dearest girl in the world. We made quite a gayprocession of it, and my child-wife was the gayest there.\\nBut, sometimes, when I took her up, and felt that she was lighter in my arms, a\\ndead blank feeling came upon me, as if I were approaching to some frozen regionyet unseen, that numbed my life. I avoided the recognition of this feeling by anyname, or by any communing with myself; until one night, when it was very strongupon me, and my aunt had left her with a parting cry of 'Good night, LittleBlossom,' I sat down at my desk alone, and cried to think, Oh what a fatal name itwas, and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree!\\nCHAPTER 49.

Mr. PEGGOTTY'S DREAM\\nCOMES TRUE\\nBy this time, some months had passed since our interview on the bank of the river\\nwith Martha. I had never seen her since, but she had communicated with  Mr.Peggotty on several occasions. Nothing had come of her zealous intervention; norcould I infer, from what he told me, that any clue had been obtained, for amoment, to Emily's fate. I confess that I began to despair of her recovery, andgradually to sink deeper and deeper into the belief that she was dead.\\nHis conviction remained unchanged. So far as I know—and I believe  his  honest\\nheart was transparent to me—he never wavered again, in his solemn certainty offinding her. His patience never tired. And, although I trembled for the agony  itmight one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow, there wassomething so religious in it, so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in  thepurest depths of his fine nature, that the respect and honour in which I held himwere exalted every day.\\nHis was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped, and did no more. He had been a man of\\nsturdy action all his life, and he knew that in all things wherein he wanted help hemust do his own part faithfully, and help himself. I have known him set out in thenight, on a misgiving that the light might not be, by some accident, in the windowof the old boat, and walk to Yarmouth. I have known him, on reading something inthe newspaper that might apply to her, take up his stick, and go forth on a journeyof three—or four-score miles. He made his way by sea to Naples, and back, afterhearing the narrative to which Miss Dartle had assisted me. All his journeys wereruggedly performed; for he was always steadfast in a purpose of saving money forEmily's sake, when she should be found. In all this long pursuit, I never heard himrepine; I never heard him say he was fatigued, or out of heart.\\nDora had often seen him since our marriage, and was quite fond of him. I fancy his\\nfigure before me now, standing near her sofa, with his rough cap in his hand, andthe blue eyes of my child-wife raised, with a timid wonder, to his face. Sometimesof an evening, about twilight, when he came to talk with me, I would induce him tosmoke his pipe in the garden, as we slowly paced to and fro together; and then, thepicture of his deserted home, and the comfortable air it used to have in my childisheyes of an evening when the fire was burning, and the wind moaning round it,came most vividly into my mind.\\nOne evening, at this hour, he told me that he had found Martha waiting near his\"),\n",

I demanded.'No, Mas'r Davy,' he returned, drawing his hand thoughtfully down his face.  'I\\nasked that too; but it was more (she said) than she could tell.'\\nAs I had long forborne to encourage him with hopes that hung on threads, I made\\nno other comment on this information than that I supposed he would see her soon.Such speculations as it engendered within me I kept to myself, and those were faintenough.\\nI was walking alone in the garden, one evening, about a fortnight afterwards. I\\nremember that evening well. It was the second in Mr. Micawber's week ofsuspense. There had been rain all day, and there was a damp feeling in the air. Theleaves were thick upon the trees, and heavy with wet; but the rain had ceased,though the sky was still dark; and the hopeful birds were singing cheerfully. As Iwalked to and fro in the garden, and the twilight began to close around me, theirlittle voices were hushed; and that peculiar silence which belongs to such anevening in the country when the lightest trees are quite still, save for the occasionaldroppings from their boughs, prevailed.\\nThere was a little green perspective of trellis-work and ivy at the side of  our\\ncottage, through which I could see, from the garden where I was walking, into theroad before the house. I happened to turn my eyes towards this place, as  I  wasthinking of many things; and I saw a figure beyond, dressed in a plain cloak. It wasbending eagerly towards me, and beckoning.\\n'Martha!' said I, going to it.'Can you come with me?' she inquired, in an agitated whisper. 'I have been to him,\\nand he is not at home. I wrote down where he was to come, and left it on his tablewith my own hand. They said he would not be out long. I have tidings for him. Canyou come directly?'\\nMy answer was, to pass out at the gate immediately. She made a hasty gesture with\\nher hand, as if to entreat my patience and my silence, and turned towards London,whence, as her dress betokened, she had come expeditiously on foot.\\nI asked her if that were not our destination? On her motioning Yes, with the same\\nhasty gesture as before, I stopped an empty coach that was coming by, and we gotinto it. When I asked her where the coachman was to drive, she answered,'Anywhere near Golden Square! And quick!'—then shrunk into a corner, with onetrembling hand before her face, and the other making the former gesture, as if shecould not bear a voice.\\nNow much disturbed, and dazzled with conflicting gleams of hope and dread,  I\\nlooked at her for some explanation. But seeing how strongly she desired to remainquiet, and feeling that it was my own natural inclination too, at such a time, I didnot attempt to break the silence. We proceeded without a word being spoken.Sometimes she glanced out of the window, as though she thought we were goingslowly, though indeed we were going fast; but otherwise remained exactly  as  at\"),\n",

She laid her hand on my arm, and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets, ofwhich there are several in that part, where the houses were once fair dwellings inthe occupation of single families, but have, and had, long degenerated  into  poorlodgings let off in rooms. Entering at the open door of one of these, and releasingmy arm, she beckoned me to follow her up the common staircase, which was like atributary channel to the street.\\nThe house swarmed with inmates. As we went up, doors of rooms were opened and\\npeople's heads put out; and we passed other people on the stairs, who were comingdown. In glancing up from the outside, before we entered, I had seen women andchildren lolling at the windows over flower-pots; and we seemed to have attractedtheir curiosity, for these were principally the observers who looked out of theirdoors. It was a broad panelled staircase, with massive balustrades of some  darkwood; cornices above the doors, ornamented with carved fruit and flowers; andbroad seats in the windows. But all these tokens of past grandeur were miserablydecayed and dirty; rot, damp, and age, had weakened the flooring, which in manyplaces was unsound and even unsafe. Some attempts had been made, I noticed, toinfuse new blood into this dwindling frame, by repairing the costly old wood-workhere and there with common deal; but it was like the marriage of  a  reduced  oldnoble to a plebeian pauper, and each party to the ill-assorted union shrunk awayfrom the other. Several of the back windows on the staircase had been darkened orwholly blocked up. In those that remained, there was scarcely any glass; and,through the crumbling frames by which the bad air seemed always to come in, andnever to go out, I saw, through other glassless windows, into other houses in asimilar condition, and looked giddily down into a wretched yard, which  was  thecommon dust-heap of the mansion.\\nWe proceeded to the top-storey of the house. Two or three times, by the way, I\\nthought I observed in the indistinct light the skirts of a female figure going upbefore us. As we turned to ascend the last flight of stairs between us and the roof,we caught a full view of this figure pausing for a moment, at a door. Then it turnedthe handle, and went in.\\n'What's this!' said Martha, in a whisper. 'She has gone into my room. I don't know\\nher!'\\nI knew her. I had recognized her with amazement, for Miss Dartle.I said something to the effect that it was a lady whom I  had seen before, in a few\\nwords, to my conductress; and had scarcely done so, when we heard her voice inthe room, though not, from where we stood, what she was saying. Martha, with anastonished look, repeated her former action, and softly led me up the stairs; andthen, by a little back-door which seemed to have no lock, and which she pushedopen with a touch, into a small empty garret with a low sloping roof, little betterthan a cupboard. Between this, and the room she had called hers, there was a smalldoor of communication, standing partly open. Here we stopped, breathless with ourascent, and she placed her hand lightly on my lips. I could only see, of the roombeyond, that it was pretty large; that there was a bed in it; and that there were somecommon pictures of ships upon the walls. I could not see Miss Dartle, or the personwhom we had heard her address. Certainly, my companion could not, for myposition was the best. A dead silence prevailed for some moments.

'Then I am sure I will!'So, she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty's, and walked with him to a leafy little\\nsummer-house there was at the bottom of the garden, where she sat down on abench, and I beside her. There was a seat for Mr. Peggotty too, but he preferred tostand, leaning his hand on the small rustic table. As he stood, looking at his cap fora little while before beginning to speak, I could not help observing what power andforce of character his sinewy hand expressed, and what a good and trustycompanion it was to his honest brow and iron-grey hair.\\n'I took my dear child away last night,' Mr. Peggotty began, as he raised his eyes to\\nours, 'to my lodging, wheer I have a long time been expecting of her and preparingfur her.

He presently came home, very glad to seeme; and I hope they were all the better for my being there. We spoke, with someapproach to cheerfulness, of Mr. Peggotty's growing rich in a new country, and ofthe wonders he would describe in his letters. We said nothing of Emily by name,but distantly referred to her more than once. Ham was the serenest of the party.\\nBut, Peggotty told me, when she lighted me to a little chamber where the Crocodile\\nbook was lying ready for me on the table, that he always was the same. Shebelieved (she told me, crying) that he was broken-hearted; though he was as full ofcourage as of sweetness, and worked harder and better than any boat-builder in anyyard in all that part. There were times, she said, of an evening, when he talked oftheir old life in the boat-house; and then he mentioned Emily as a child.

If the events I go on to relate, had not thickened around me, in thebeginning to confuse, and in the end to augment, my affliction, it is possible(though I think not probable), that I might have fallen at once into this condition.As it was, an interval occurred before I fully knew my own distress; an interval, inwhich I even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past; and when my mind couldsoothe itself by resting on all that was most innocent and beautiful, in the tenderstory that was closed for ever.\\nWhen it was first proposed that I should go abroad, or how it came to be agreed\\namong us that I was to seek the restoration of my peace in change and travel, I donot, even now, distinctly know.

The heat into which he has been continually putting himself; andthe distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving, day and night,among papers and books; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he haswritten me between this house and Mr. Wickfield's, and often across the  tablewhen he has been sitting opposite, and might much more easily have spoken; isquite extraordinary.'\\n'Letters!' cried my aunt.

At times, even his impaired power of concentrating his memory andattention on particular points of business, has recovered itself very much; and hehas been able to assist us in making some things clear, that we should have foundvery difficult indeed, if not hopeless, without him. But what I have to do is to cometo results; which are short enough; not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances Ihave observed, or I shall never have done.' His natural manner and agreeablesimplicity made it transparent that he said this to put us in good heart, and to enableAgnes to hear her father mentioned with greater confidence; but it was not the lesspleasant for that.\\n'Now, let me see,' said Traddles, looking among the papers on the table.

It wasafterwards pretended to Mr. Wickfield, by that rascal,—and proved, too, by figures,—that he had possessed himself of the money (on general instructions, he said) tokeep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light.

A most remarkable circumstance is, that I really don'tthink he grasped this sum even so much for the gratification of his avarice, whichwas inordinate, as in the hatred he felt for Copperfield. He said so to me, plainly.He said he would even have spent as much, to baulk or injure Copperfield.'\\n'Ha!' said my aunt, knitting her brows thoughtfully, and glancing at Agnes. 'And\\nwhat's become of him?'\\n'I don't know. He left here,' said Traddles, 'with his mother, who had been\\nclamouring, and beseeching, and disclosing, the whole time. They went away byone of the London night coaches, and I know no more about him; except that  hismalevolence to me at parting was audacious. He seemed to consider himself hardlyless indebted to me, than to Mr. Micawber; which I consider (as I told him) quite acompliment.'\\n'Do you suppose he has any money, Traddles?' I asked.'Oh dear, yes, I should think so,' he replied, shaking his head, seriously. 'I should\\nsay he must have pocketed a good deal, in one way or other. But, I think youwould find, Copperfield, if you had an opportunity of observing his course,  thatmoney would never keep that man out of mischief. He is such an incarnatehypocrite, that whatever object he pursues, he must pursue crookedly. It's his onlycompensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself. Always  creepingalong the ground to some small end or other, he will always magnify every objectin the way; and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that comes, in themost innocent manner, between him and it. So the crooked courses  will  becomecrookeder, at any moment, for the least reason, or for none. It's only necessary toconsider his history here,' said Traddles, 'to know that.'\\n'He's a monster of meanness!' said my aunt.'Really I don't know about that,' observed Traddles thoughtfully. 'Many people can\\nbe very mean, when they give their minds to it.'\\n'And now, touching Mr. Micawber,' said my aunt.'Well, really,' said Traddles, cheerfully, 'I must, once more, give Mr. Micawber\\nhigh praise. But for his having been so patient and persevering for so long a time,we never could have hoped to do anything worth speaking of. And I think we oughtto consider that Mr. Micawber did right, for right's sake, when we reflect whatterms he might have made with Uriah Heep himself, for his silence.'\\n'I think so too,' said I.'Now, what would you give him?' inquired my aunt.'Oh! Before you come to that,' said Traddles, a little disconcerted, 'I  am  afraid  I\\nthought it discreet to omit (not being able to carry everything before me) twopoints, in making this lawless adjustment—for it's perfectly lawless from beginningto end—of a difficult affair.

'Agnes, my dear,\\nyou and I can talk about division of it afterwards. What should it be? Five hundredpounds?'\\nUpon this, Traddles and I both struck in at once. We both recommended a small\\nsum in money, and the payment, without stipulation to Mr. Micawber, of the Uriahclaims as they came in. We proposed that the family should have their passage andtheir outfit, and a hundred pounds; and that Mr. Micawber's arrangement  for  therepayment of the advances should be gravely entered into, as it might bewholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility. To this, I addedthe suggestion, that I should give some explanation of his character and history toMr. Peggotty, who I knew could be relied on; and that  to Mr. Peggotty should bequietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another hundred. I further proposed tointerest Mr. Micawber in Mr. Peggotty, by confiding so much of  Mr.  Peggotty'sstory to him as I might feel justified in relating, or might think expedient; and toendeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the other, for the common advantage.We all entered warmly into these views; and I may mention at once, that theprincipals themselves did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will andharmony.\\nSeeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, I reminded him of\\nthe second and last point to which he had adverted.\\n'You and your aunt will excuse me, Copperfield, if I touch upon a painful theme, as\\nI greatly fear I shall,' said Traddles, hesitating; 'but I think it necessary to bring it toyour recollection. On the day of Mr. Micawber's memorable denunciation athreatening allusion was made by Uriah Heep to your aunt's—husband.'\\nMy aunt, retaining her stiff position, and apparent composure, assented with a nod.'Perhaps,' observed Traddles, 'it was mere purposeless impertinence?''No,' returned my aunt.'There was—pardon me—really such a person, and at all in his power?' hinted\\nTraddles.\\n'Yes, my good friend,' said my aunt.Traddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained that he had not been\\nable to approach this subject; that it had shared the fate of Mr. Micawber'sliabilities, in not being comprehended in the terms he had made; that  we were nolonger of any authority with Uriah Heep; and that if he could do us, or any of us,any injury or annoyance, no doubt he would.\\nMy aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way to her cheeks.\\n'You are quite right,' she said.

TEMPEST\\nI now approach an event in my life, so indelible, so awful, so bound by an  infinitevariety of ties to all that has preceded it, in these pages, that, from the beginning ofmy narrative, I have seen it growing larger and larger as I advanced, like  a greattower in a plain, and throwing its fore-cast shadow even on the  incidents  of  mychildish days.\\nFor years after it occurred, I dreamed of it often. I have started up so  vividly\\nimpressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room, in the stillnight. I dream of it sometimes, though at lengthened and uncertain intervals, to thishour. I have an association between it and a stormy wind, or  the lightest mentionof a sea-shore, as strong as any of which my mind is conscious. As plainly as Ibehold what happened, I will try to write it down. I do not recall it, but see it done;for it happens again before me.\\nThe time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship, my good old\\nnurse (almost broken-hearted for me, when we first met) came up to London. I wasconstantly with her, and her brother, and the Micawbers (they being very  muchtogether); but Emily I never saw.\\nOne evening when the time was close at hand, I was alone with Peggotty and her\\nbrother. Our conversation turned on Ham. She described to us how tenderly he had\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'david-Cooper.pdf', 'page': 540}, page_content=\"taken leave of her, and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself. Most of all,\\nof late, when she believed he was most tried. It was a subject of which the\\naffectionate creature never tired; and our interest in hearing the many exampleswhich she, who was so much with him, had to relate, was equal to hers in relatingthem.\\nMY aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Highgate; I intending\\nto go abroad, and she to return to her house at Dover. We had a temporary lodgingin Covent Garden. As I walked home to it, after this evening's  conversation,reflecting on what had passed between Ham and myself when I was last atYarmouth, I wavered in the original purpose I had formed, of leaving a letter forEmily when I should take leave of her uncle on board the ship, and thought itwould be better to write to her now. She might desire, I thought, after receiving mycommunication, to send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover. I ought togive her the opportunity.\\nI therefore sat down in my room, before going to bed, and wrote to her. I told her\\nthat I had seen him, and that he had requested me to tell her what I have alreadywritten in its place in these sheets. I faithfully repeated it. I had no need to enlargeupon it, if I had had the right. Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to  beadorned by me or any man. I left it out, to be sent round in the morning; with a lineto Mr. Peggotty, requesting him to give it to her; and went to bed at daybreak.\\nI was weaker than I knew then; and, not falling asleep until the sun was up, lay\\nlate, and unrefreshed, next day. I was roused by the silent presence of my aunt atmy bedside. I felt it in my sleep, as I suppose we all do feel such things.\\n'Trot, my dear,' she said, when I opened my eyes, 'I couldn't make up my mind to\\ndisturb you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?'\\nI replied yes, and he soon appeared.'Mas'r Davy,' he said, when we had shaken hands, 'I giv Em'ly your letter, sir, and\\nshe writ this heer; and begged of me fur to ask you to read it, and if you see no hurtin't, to be so kind as take charge on't.'\\n'Have you read it?' said I.He nodded sorrowfully. I opened it, and read as follows:'I have got your message. Oh, what can I write, to thank you for your good and\\nblessed kindness to me!\\n'I have put the words close to my heart. I shall keep them till I die. They are sharp\\nthorns, but they are such comfort. I have prayed over them, oh, I have prayed somuch. When I find what you are, and what uncle is, I think what God must be, andcan cry to him.\\n'Good-bye for ever. Now, my dear, my friend, good-bye for ever in this world. In\\nanother world, if I am forgiven, I may wake a child and come to you. All  thanksand blessings. Farewell, evermore.'\\nThis, blotted with tears, was the letter.'May I tell her as you doen't see no hurt in't, and as you'll be so kind as take charge\\non't, Mas'r Davy?' said Mr. Peggotty, when I had read it. 'Unquestionably,' said I—'but I am thinking—'\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'david-Cooper.pdf', 'page': 541}, page_content=\"'Yes, Mas'r Davy?'\\n'I am thinking,' said I, 'that I'll go down again to Yarmouth. There's time, and to\\nspare, for me to go and come back before the ship sails. My  mind  is  constantlyrunning on him, in his solitude; to put this letter of her writing in his hand at thistime, and to enable you to tell her, in the moment of parting, that he has got it, willbe a kindness to both of them. I solemnly accepted his commission, dear goodfellow, and cannot discharge it too completely. The journey is nothing to me. I amrestless, and shall be better in motion. I'll go down tonight.'\\nThough he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me, I saw that he was of my mind;\\nand this, if I had required to be confirmed in my intention, would have  had  theeffect. He went round to the coach office, at my request, and took the box-seat forme on the mail. In the evening I started, by that  conveyance, down the road I hadtraversed under so many vicissitudes.\\n'Don't you think that,' I asked the coachman, in the first stage out of London, 'a very\\nremarkable sky? I don't remember to have seen one like it.'\\n'Nor I—not equal to it,' he replied. 'That's wind, sir. There'll be mischief done at\\nsea, I expect, before long.'\\nIt was a murky confusion—here and there blotted with a colour like  the colour of\\nthe smoke from damp fuel—of flying clouds, tossed up into most remarkableheaps, suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below themto the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth, through which  the  wild  moonseemed to plunge headlong, as if, in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature, shehad lost her way and were frightened. There had been a wind all  day; and it wasrising then, with an extraordinary great sound. In another hour it had muchincreased, and the sky was more overcast, and blew hard.\\nBut, as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely over-spreading the\\nwhole sky, then very dark, it came on to blow, harder and harder. It still increased,until our horses could scarcely face the wind. Many times, in the dark part of thenight (it was then late in September, when the nights were not short), the leadersturned about, or came to a dead stop; and we were often in serious apprehensionthat the coach would be blown over. Sweeping gusts of rain came up before thisstorm, like showers of steel; and, at those times, when there was any shelter of treesor lee walls to be got, we were fain to stop, in a sheer impossibility of continuingthe struggle.\\nWhen the day broke, it blew harder and harder. I had been in Yarmouth when the\\nseamen said it blew great guns, but I had never known the like of this, or anythingapproaching to it. We came to Ipswich—very late, having had to fight every inchof ground since we were ten miles out of London; and found a cluster of people inthe market-place, who had risen from their beds in the night, fearful of fallingchimneys. Some of these, congregating about the inn-yard while we changedhorses, told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church-tower,and flung into a by-street, which they then blocked up. Others had to tell of countrypeople, coming in from neighbouring villages, who had seen great trees lying tornout of the earth, and whole ricks scattered about the roads and fields. Still, therewas no abatement in the storm, but it blew harder.\\nAs we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea, from which this mighty wind was\\nblowing dead on shore, its force became more and more terrific. Long before wesaw the sea, its spray was on our lips, and showered salt rain upon us.  The water\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'david-Cooper.pdf', 'page': 542}, page_content=\"was out, over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth; and every\\nsheet and puddle lashed its banks, and had its stress of little breakers setting\\nheavily towards us. When we came within sight of the sea, the waves on thehorizon, caught at intervals above the rolling abyss, were like  glimpses of anothershore with towers and buildings. When at last we got into the town, the  peoplecame out to their doors, all aslant, and with streaming hair, making a wonder of themail that had come through such a night.\\nI put up at the old inn, and went down to look at the sea; staggering  along  the\\nstreet, which was strewn with sand and seaweed, and with flying blotches of sea-foam; afraid of falling slates and tiles; and holding by people I met, at  angrycorners. Coming near the beach, I saw, not only the boatmen, but half the people ofthe town, lurking behind buildings; some, now and then braving the fury of  thestorm to look away to sea, and blown sheer out of their course in trying  to  getzigzag back.\\nJoining these groups, I found bewailing women whose husbands were away  in\\nherring or oyster boats, which there was too much reason to think might  havefoundered before they could run in anywhere for safety. Grizzled old sailors wereamong the people, shaking their heads, as they looked from water to sky,  andmuttering to one another; ship-owners, excited and uneasy; children, huddlingtogether, and peering into older faces; even stout mariners, disturbed and anxious,levelling their glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter, as if they weresurveying an enemy.\\nThe tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient pause to look at it, in the\\nagitation of the blinding wind, the flying stones and sand, and the awful noise,confounded me. As the high watery walls came rolling in, and, at their  highest,tumbled into surf, they looked as if the least would engulf the town. As  thereceding wave swept back with a hoarse roar, it seemed to scoop out deep caves inthe beach, as if its purpose were to undermine the earth. When some white-headedbillows thundered on, and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached  theland, every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of itswrath, rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster. Undulatinghills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys (with a solitary storm -birdsometimes skimming through them) were lifted up to hills; masses of watershivered and shook the beach with a booming sound; every shape tumultuouslyrolled on, as soon as made, to change its shape and place, and beat another shapeand place away; the ideal shore on the horizon, with its towers and buildings, roseand fell; the clouds fell fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving ofall nature.\\nNot finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind—for it is  still\\nremembered down there, as the greatest ever known to blow upon that  coast—hadbrought together, I made my way to his house. It was shut; and as no one answeredto my knocking, I went, by back ways and by-lanes, to the yard where he worked. Ilearned, there, that he had gone to Lowestoft, to meet some sudden  exigency  ofship-repairing in which his skill was required; but that he would be back tomorrowmorning, in good time.\\nI went back to the inn; and when I had washed and dressed, and tried to sleep, but\\nin vain, it was five o'clock in the afternoon. I had not sat five minutes  by thecoffee-room fire, when the waiter, coming to stir it, as an excuse for talking, toldme that two colliers had gone down, with all hands, a few miles away; and thatsome other ships had been seen labouring hard in the Roads, and trying, in great\"),\n",

Mercy on them, and on all poor sailors, said he, if we\\nhad another night like the last!\\nI was very much depressed in spirits; very solitary; and felt an uneasiness in Ham's\\nnot being there, disproportionate to the occasion. I was seriously affected, withoutknowing how much, by late events; and my long exposure to the fierce wind hadconfused me. There was that jumble in my thoughts and recollections, that I hadlost the clear arrangement of time and distance. Thus, if I had gone out into thetown, I should not have been surprised, I think, to encounter someone who I knewmust be then in London. So to speak, there was in these respects a curiousinattention in my mind. Yet it was busy, too, with all  the remembrances the placenaturally awakened; and they were particularly distinct and vivid.\\nIn this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected\\nitself, without any effort of my volition, with my uneasiness about Ham. I waspersuaded that I had an apprehension of his returning from Lowestoft by sea,  andbeing lost. This grew so strong with me, that I resolved to go back to  the  yardbefore I took my dinner, and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting toreturn by sea at all likely? If he gave me the least reason to think so, I would goover to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me.\\nI hastily ordered my dinner, and went back to the yard. I was none too soon; for the\\nboat-builder, with a lantern in his hand, was locking the yard-gate. He quitelaughed when I asked him the question, and said there was no fear;  no man  in hissenses, or out of them, would put off in such a gale of wind, least of all  HamPeggotty, who had been born to seafaring.\\nSo sensible of this, beforehand, that I had really felt ashamed of doing what I was\\nnevertheless impelled to do, I went back to the inn. If such a wind could rise, Ithink it was rising. The howl and roar, the rattling of the doors and windows, therumbling in the chimneys, the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me,and the prodigious tumult of the sea, were more fearful than in the morning. Butthere was now a great darkness besides; and that invested the storm with  newterrors, real and fanciful.\\nI could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not continue steadfast to anything.\\nSomething within me, faintly answering to the storm without, tossed up the depthsof my memory and made a tumult in them. Yet, in all the hurry of my thoughts,wild running with the thundering sea,—the storm, and my uneasiness regardingHam were always in the fore-ground.\\nMy dinner went away almost untasted, and I tried to refresh myself with a glass or\\ntwo of wine. In vain. I fell into a dull slumber before the fire, without losing myconsciousness, either of the uproar out of doors, or of the place in which I was.Both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror; and when I awoke—or rather when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair—my  wholeframe thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear.\\nI walked to and fro, tried to read an old gazetteer, listened to the  awful  noises:\\nlooked at faces, scenes, and figures in the fire. At length, the steady ticking of theundisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree that  I resolved to go tobed.\\nIt was reassuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the inn -servants had\\nagreed together to sit up until morning. I went to bed, exceedingly  weary  andheavy; but, on my lying down, all such sensations vanished, as if by magic,  and I\"),\n",

I got up, several times, and looked out; but could seenothing, except the reflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I  had  leftburning, and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void.\\nAt length, my restlessness attained to such a pitch, that I hurried on my clothes, and\\nwent downstairs. In the large kitchen, where I dimly saw bacon and ropes ofonions hanging from the beams, the watchers were clustered together, in variousattitudes, about a table, purposely moved away from the great chimney, andbrought near the door. A pretty girl, who had her ears stopped with her apron, andher eyes upon the door, screamed when I appeared, supposing me to be a spirit; butthe others had more presence of mind, and were glad of an addition to theircompany. One man, referring to the topic they had been discussing, asked mewhether I thought the souls of the collier-crews who had gone down, were out inthe storm?\\nI remained there, I dare say, two hours. Once, I opened the yard-gate, and looked\\ninto the empty street. The sand, the sea-weed, and the flakes of foam, were drivingby; and I was obliged to call for assistance before I could shut the gate again, andmake it fast against the wind.\\nThere was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber, when I at length returned to it; but\\nI was tired now, and, getting into bed again, fell—off a tower and down a precipice—into the depths of sleep. I have an impression that for a long time, though Idreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes, it was always blowing inmy dream. At length, I lost that feeble hold upon reality, and was engaged with twodear friends, but who they were I don't know, at the siege of some town in a roar ofcannonading.\\nThe thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I could not hear\\nsomething I much desired to hear, until I made a great exertion and awoke. It wasbroad day—eight or nine o'clock; the storm raging, in lieu of the batteries; andsomeone knocking and calling at my door.\\n'What is the matter?' I cried.'A wreck! Close by!'I sprung out of bed, and asked, what wreck?'A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. Make haste, sir, if\\nyou want to see her! It's thought, down on the beach, she'll go to pieces everymoment.'\\nThe excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; and I wrapped myself in\\nmy clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into the street.\\nNumbers of people were there before me, all running in one direction, to the beach.\\nI ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon came facing the wild sea.\\nThe wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not more sensibly than if\\nthe cannonading I had dreamed of, had been diminished by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds.

In the difficulty of\\nhearing anything but wind and waves, and in the crowd, and the unspeakableconfusion, and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather, I was  soconfused that I looked out to sea for the wreck, and saw nothing but the foamingheads of the great waves. A half-dressed boatman, standing next me, pointed  withhis bare arm (a tattoo'd arrow on it, pointing in the same direction) to the left. Then,O great Heaven, I saw it, close in upon us!\\nOne mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, and lay over the\\nside, entangled in a maze of sail and rigging; and all that ruin, as the ship rolledand beat—which she did without a moment's pause, and with a violence  quiteinconceivable—beat the side as if it would stave it in. Some efforts were even thenbeing made, to cut this portion of the wreck away; for, as the ship, which  wasbroadside on, turned towards us in her rolling, I plainly descried her people at workwith axes, especially one active figure with long curling hair, conspicuous amongthe rest. But a great cry, which was audible even above the wind and  water, rosefrom the shore at this moment; the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck, made aclean breach, and carried men, spars, casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys,into the boiling surge.\\nThe second mast was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and a wild\\nconfusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The ship had struck once,  thesame boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted in and struck again. Iunderstood him to add that she was parting amidships, and I could readily supposeso, for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to sufferlong. As he spoke, there was another great cry of pity from the beach; four menarose with the wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast;uppermost, the active figure with the curling hair.\\nThere was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled and dashed, like a desperate\\ncreature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her deck, as she turnedon her beam-ends towards the shore, now nothing but her keel, as she  sprungwildly over and turned towards the sea, the bell rang; and its sound, the knell  ofthose unhappy men, was borne towards us on the wind. Again we lost  her,  andagain she rose. Two men were gone. The agony on the shore increased. Mengroaned, and clasped their hands; women shrieked, and turned away their  faces.Some ran wildly up and down along the beach, crying for help where no help couldbe. I found myself one of these, frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom Iknew, not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes.\\nThey were making out to me, in an agitated way—I don't know how, for the little I\\ncould hear I was scarcely composed enough to understand—that the lifeboat hadbeen bravely manned an hour ago, and could do nothing; and that as no man wouldbe so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope, and establish acommunication with the shore, there was nothing left to try; when I noticed thatsome new sensation moved the people on the beach, and saw them  part, and Hamcome breaking through them to the front.\\nI ran to him—as well as I know, to repeat my appeal for help. But, distracted\\nthough I was, by a sight so new to me and terrible, the determination in his face,and his look out to sea—exactly the same look as I remembered in connexion withthe morning after Emily's flight—awoke me to a knowledge of his danger. I heldhim back with both arms; and implored the men with whom I  had been speaking,not to listen to him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from off that sand!\"),\n",

I don't know what I answered, or what theyrejoined; but I saw hurry on the beach, and men running with ropes from a capstanthat was there, and penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then, Isaw him standing alone, in a seaman's frock and trousers: a rope in his hand, orslung to his wrist: another round his body: and several of the best men holding, at alittle distance, to the latter, which he laid out himself, slack upon the  shore, at hisfeet.\\nThe wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking up. I saw that she was\\nparting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by athread. Still, he clung to it. He had a singular red cap on,—not like  a sailor's cap,but of a finer colour; and as the few yielding planks between him and destructionrolled and bulged, and his anticipative death-knell rung, he was seen by all of us towave it. I saw him do it now, and thought I was going distracted, when his actionbrought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend.\\nHam watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended breath behind\\nhim, and the storm before, until there was a great retiring wave, when,  with  abackward glance at those who held the rope which was made fast round his body,he dashed in after it, and in a moment was buffeting with the water; rising with thehills, falling with the valleys, lost beneath the foam; then drawn again to land. Theyhauled in hastily.\\nHe was hurt. I saw blood on his face, from where I stood; but he took no thought of\\nthat. He seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for leaving him more free—or so I judged from the motion of his arm—and was gone as before.\\nAnd now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling with the valleys, lost\\nbeneath the rugged foam, borne in towards the shore, borne on towards the ship,striving hard and valiantly. The distance was nothing, but the power of the sea andwind made the strife deadly. At length he neared the wreck. He was so near, thatwith one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it,—when a high,green, vast hill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from beyond the ship,  heseemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was gone!\\nSome eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask had been broken, in\\nrunning to the spot where they were hauling in.

I walked thelast mile, thinking as I went along of what I had to do; and left the carriage thathad followed me all through the night, awaiting orders to advance.\\nThe house, when I came up to it, looked just the same. Not a blind was raised; no\\nsign of life was in the dull paved court, with its covered way leading to the disuseddoor. The wind had quite gone down, and nothing moved.\\nI had not, at first, the courage to ring at the gate; and when I did ring, my errand\\nseemed to me to be expressed in the very sound of the bell. The little parlour-maidcame out, with the key in her hand; and looking earnestly at me as she unlockedthe gate, said:\\n'I beg your pardon, sir. Are you ill?''I have been much agitated, and am fatigued.''Is anything the matter, sir?—-Mr. James?—' 'Hush!' said I. 'Yes,  something  has\\nhappened, that I have to break to Mrs. Steerforth. She is at home?'\\nThe girl anxiously replied that her mistress was very seldom out now, even in a\\ncarriage; that she kept her room; that she saw no company, but would see me.

What message should shetake upstairs?\\nGiving her a strict charge to be careful of her manner, and only to carry in my card\\nand say I waited, I sat down in the drawing-room (which we  had  now  reached)until she should come back. Its former pleasant air of occupation was gone, and theshutters were half closed. The harp had not been used for many and many a day.His picture, as a boy, was there. The cabinet in which his mother had kept  hisletters was there.

In a few moments I stood before her.\\nShe was in his room; not in her own. I felt, of course, that she had taken to occupy\\nit, in remembrance of him; and that the many tokens of his old sports andaccomplishments, by which she was surrounded, remained there, just as he had leftthem, for the same reason. She murmured, however, even in her reception of me,that she was out of her own chamber because its aspect was unsuited to herinfirmity; and with her stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth.\\nAt her chair, as usual, was Rosa Dartle. From the first moment of her dark eyes\\nresting on me, I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil tidings. The scar sprung intoview that instant. She withdrew herself a step behind the chair, to keep her ownface out of Mrs. Steerforth's observation; and scrutinized me with a piercing gazethat never faltered, never shrunk.\\n'I am sorry to observe you are in mourning, sir,' said Mrs. Steerforth.'I am unhappily a widower,' said I.\\n'You are very young to know so great a loss,' she returned. 'I am grieved to hear it.\"),\n",

One might have supposed him a child of the wilderness, longaccustomed to live out of the confines of civilization, and about to  return  to  hisnative wilds.\\nHe had provided himself, among other things, with a complete suit of oilskin, and a\\nstraw hat with a very low crown, pitched or caulked on the outside. In this roughclothing, with a common mariner's telescope under his arm, and a shrewd trick ofcasting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather, he was  far  morenautical, after his manner, than Mr. Peggotty. His whole family, if I may so expressit, were cleared for action. I found Mrs. Micawber in the closest and mostuncompromising of bonnets, made fast under the chin; and in a shawl which tiedher up (as I had been tied up, when my aunt first received me) like  a bundle, andwas secured behind at the waist, in a strong knot. Miss Micawber  I  found  madesnug for stormy weather, in the same manner; with nothing superfluous about her.Master Micawber was hardly visible in a Guernsey shirt, and the shaggiest suit ofslops I ever saw; and the children were done up, like preserved meats, inimpervious cases. Both Mr. Micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves looselyturned back at the wrists, as being ready to lend a hand in any direction, and to'tumble up', or sing out, 'Yeo—Heave—Yeo!' on the shortest notice.\\nThus Traddles and I found them at nightfall, assembled on the wooden steps, at that\\ntime known as Hungerford Stairs, watching the departure of a boat with some oftheir property on board. I had told Traddles of the terrible event, and it had greatlyshocked him; but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret, andhe had come to help me in this last service. It was here that  I took Mr. Micawberaside, and received his promise.\\nThe Micawber family were lodged in a little, dirty, tumble-down public-house,\\nwhich in those days was close to the stairs, and whose protruding wooden roomsoverhung the river. The family, as emigrants, being objects of some interest in andabout Hungerford, attracted so many beholders, that we were glad to take refuge intheir room. It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs, with the  tide  flowingunderneath. My aunt and Agnes were there, busily making some little extracomforts, in the way of dress, for the children. Peggotty was quietly assisting, withthe old insensible work-box, yard-measure, and bit of wax-candle before her, thathad now outlived so much.\\nIt was not easy to answer her inquiries; still less to whisper Mr. Peggotty, when Mr.\\nMicawber brought him in, that I had given the letter, and all was well.

From this document, I learned that Mr. Micawber being again arrested,\\'Was in a final paroxysm of despair; and that he begged me to send him his knifeand pint pot, by bearer, as they might prove serviceable during the brief remainderof his existence, in jail. He also requested, as a last act of friendship, that I wouldsee his family to the Parish Workhouse, and forget that such a Being ever lived.\\nOf course I answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the  money,\\nwhere I found Mr. Micawber sitting in a corner, looking darkly at  the  Sheriff  \\'sOfficer who had effected the capture. On his release, he embraced me with  theutmost fervour; and made an entry of the transaction in his  pocket -book—beingvery particular, I recollect, about a halfpenny I inadvertently omitted from mystatement of the total.\\nThis momentous pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another transaction.\\nOn our return to the room upstairs (where he accounted for his absence by sayingthat it had been occasioned by circumstances over which he had no control),  hetook out of it a large sheet of paper, folded small, and quite covered with  longsums, carefully worked. From the glimpse I had of them, I should say that I neversaw such sums out of a school ciphering-book. These, it seemed, were calculationsof compound interest on what he called \\'the principal amount of forty -one, ten,eleven and a half\\', for various periods. After a careful consideration of these, andan elaborate estimate of his resources, he had come to the conclusion to select thatsum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years, fifteencalendar months, and fourteen days, from that date. For this he had drawn a note-of-hand with great neatness, which he handed over to Traddles on the spot,  adischarge of his debt in full (as between man and man), with manyacknowledgements.\\n\\'I have still a presentiment,\\' said Mrs. Micawber, pensively shaking her head, \\'that\\nmy family will appear on board, before we finally depart.\\'\\nMr. Micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too, but he put it in his\\ntin pot and swallowed it.'),\n",

Amongthe great beams, bulks, and ringbolts of the ship, and the emigrant -berths, andchests, and bundles, and barrels, and heaps of miscellaneous baggage—'lighted up,here and there, by dangling lanterns; and elsewhere by the yellow daylight strayingdown a windsail or a hatchway—were crowded groups of people, making newfriendships, taking leave of one another, talking, laughing, crying, eating anddrinking; some, already settled down into the possession of their few feet of space,with their little households arranged, and tiny children established on stools,  or indwarf elbow-chairs; others, despairing of a resting-place, and wanderingdisconsolately. From babies who had but a week or two of life behind  them,  tocrooked old men and women who seemed to have but a week or two of life beforethem; and from ploughmen bodily carrying out soil of England on their boots, tosmiths taking away samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins; every age andoccupation appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the 'tween decks.\"),\n",

But in the rapid motion andconfusion, and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts, I lost it again; and onlyknew that the time was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship;that my nurse was crying on a chest beside me;  and that  Mrs. Gummidge,  assistedby some younger stooping woman in black, was busily arranging  Mr.  Peggotty'sgoods.\\n'Is there any last wured, Mas'r Davy?' said he.

ABSENCE\\nIt was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me, haunted by the ghosts of many\\nhopes, of many dear remembrances, many errors, many unavailing sorrows andregrets.\\nI went away from England; not knowing, even then, how great the shock was, that I\\nhad to bear. I left all who were dear to me, and went away; and believed that I hadborne it, and it was past. As a man upon a field of battle will receive a mortal hurt,and scarcely know that he is struck, so I, when I was left alone with  myundisciplined heart, had no conception of the wound with which it had to strive.\\nThe knowledge came upon me, not quickly, but little by little, and grain by grain.\\nThe desolate feeling with which I went abroad, deepened and widened hourly. Atfirst it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow, wherein I could distinguish little else.By imperceptible degrees, it became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost—love, friendship, interest; of all that had been shattered—my first trust, my firstaffection, the whole airy castle of my life; of all that remained—a ruined blank andwaste, lying wide around me, unbroken, to the dark horizon.\\nIf my grief were selfish, I did not know it to be so. I mourned for my child -wife,\\ntaken from her blooming world, so young. I mourned for him who might have wonthe love and admiration of thousands, as he had won mine long ago. I mourned forthe broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea; and for the  wanderingremnants of the simple home, where I had heard the night-wind blowing, when Iwas a child.\\nFrom the accumulated sadness into which I fell, I had at length no hope of ever\\nissuing again. I roamed from place to place, carrying my burden with meeverywhere. I felt its whole weight now; and I drooped beneath it, and I said in myheart that it could never be lightened.\\nWhen this despondency was at its worst, I believed that I should die. Sometimes, I\\nthought that I would like to die at home; and actually turned back on my road, that Imight get there soon. At other times, I passed on farther  away,—from city  to city,seeking I know not what, and trying to leave I know not what behind.\\nIt is not in my power to retrace, one by one, all the weary  phases  of  distress of\\nmind through which I passed. There are some dreams that can only be imperfectlyand vaguely described; and when I oblige myself to look back on this  time of mylife, I seem to be recalling such a dream. I see myself passing on among  thenovelties of foreign towns, palaces, cathedrals, temples, pictures, castles, tombs,fantastic streets—the old abiding places of History and Fancy—as a dreamermight; bearing my painful load through all, and hardly conscious of the objects asthey fade before me. Listlessness to everything, but brooding sorrow, was the nightthat fell on my undisciplined heart. Let me look up from it—as at last I did, thankHeaven!—and from its long, sad, wretched dream, to dawn.\\nFor many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon my mind.

I had had no purpose, no sustaining soul within me,\\nanywhere.\\nI was in Switzerland. I had come out of Italy, over one of the great passes of the\\nAlps, and had since wandered with a guide among the by-ways of the mountains. Ifthose awful solitudes had spoken to my heart, I did not know it. I had  foundsublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices, in the roaring torrents,and the wastes of ice and snow; but as yet, they had taught me nothing else.\\nI came, one evening before sunset, down into a valley, where I was to rest. In the\\ncourse of my descent to it, by the winding track along the mountain-side, fromwhich I saw it shining far below, I think some long-unwonted sense of beauty andtranquillity, some softening influence awakened by its peace, moved faintly in mybreast. I remember pausing once, with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive,not quite despairing. I remember almost hoping that some better change waspossible within me.\\nI came into the valley, as the evening sun was shining on the  remote  heights  of\\nsnow, that closed it in, like eternal clouds. The bases of the mountains forming thegorge in which the little village lay, were richly green; and high above this gentlervegetation, grew forests of dark fir, cleaving the wintry snow-drift, wedge-like, andstemming the avalanche. Above these, were range upon range of craggy steeps,grey rock, bright ice, and smooth verdure-specks of pasture, all gradually blendingwith the crowning snow. Dotted here and there on the mountain's-side, each tinydot a home, were lonely wooden cottages, so dwarfed by the towering heights thatthey appeared too small for toys. So did even the clustered village in the valley,with its wooden bridge across the stream, where the stream tumbled over brokenrocks, and roared away among the trees. In the quiet air, there was a sound ofdistant singing—shepherd voices; but, as one bright evening cloud floated midwayalong the mountain's-side, I could almost have believed it came from  there,  andwas not earthly music. All at once, in this serenity, great Nature spoke to me; andsoothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass, and weep as I had not weptyet, since Dora died!\\nI had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before, and  had\\nstrolled out of the village to read them while my supper was making  ready. Otherpackets had missed me, and I had received none for a long time. Beyond a line ortwo, to say that I was well, and had arrived at such a place, I had not had fortitudeor constancy to write a letter since I left home.\\nThe packet was in my hand. I opened it, and read the writing of Agnes.She was happy and useful, was prospering as she had hoped. That was all she told\\nme of herself. The rest referred to me.\\nShe gave me no advice; she urged no duty on me; she only told me, in her own\\nfervent manner, what her trust in me was. She knew (she said) how such a natureas mine would turn affliction to good. She knew how trial and emotion would exaltand strengthen it. She was sure that in my every purpose I should gain a firmer anda higher tendency, through the grief I had undergone. She, who so gloried in myfame, and so looked forward to its augmentation, well knew that I would labour on.She knew that in me, sorrow could not be weakness, but must be strength. As theendurance of my childish days had done its part to make me what I was, so greatercalamities would nerve me on, to be yet better than I was; and so, as  they  hadtaught me, would I teach others.

I wrote to her before I slept. I told her that I had been\\nin sore need of her help; that without her I was not, and I never had been, what shethought me; but that she inspired me to be that, and I would try.\\nI did try. In three months more, a year would have passed since the beginning  of\\nmy sorrow. I determined to make no resolutions until the expiration of those threemonths, but to try. I lived in that valley, and its neighbourhood, all the time.\\nThe three months gone, I resolved to remain away from home for some time\\nlonger; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland, which was growing dear tome in the remembrance of that evening; to resume my pen; to work.\\nI resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me; I sought out Nature, never\\nsought in vain; and I admitted to my breast the human interest I had lately shrunkfrom. It was not long, before I had almost as many friends in the valley as inYarmouth: and when I left it, before the winter set in, for Geneva, and came backin the spring, their cordial greetings had a homely sound to me, although they werenot conveyed in English words.\\nI worked early and late, patiently and hard. I wrote a Story, with a  purpose\\ngrowing, not remotely, out of my experience, and sent it to Traddles, and hearranged for its publication very advantageously for me; and the tidings of  mygrowing reputation began to reach me from travellers whom I encountered bychance. After some rest and change, I fell to work, in my old ardent way, on a newfancy, which took strong possession of me. As I advanced in the execution of thistask, I felt it more and more, and roused my utmost energies to do it well. This wasmy third work of fiction. It was not half written, when, in an interval of  rest,  Ithought of returning home.\\nFor a long time, though studying and working patiently,  I had accustomed myself\\nto robust exercise. My health, severely impaired when I left England, was  quiterestored. I had seen much. I had been in many countries, and I hope I  hadimproved my store of knowledge.\\nI have now recalled all that I think it needful to recall here, of this term of absence\\n—with one reservation. I have made it, thus far, with no purpose of suppressingany of my thoughts; for, as I have elsewhere said, this narrative is my writtenmemory. I have desired to keep the most secret current of my mind apart, and tothe last. I enter on it now. I cannot so completely penetrate the mystery of my ownheart, as to know when I began to think that I might have set its  earliest  andbrightest hopes on Agnes. I cannot say at what stage of my grief it first becameassociated with the reflection, that, in my wayward boyhood, I had thrown awaythe treasure of her love. I believe I may have heard some whisper of that  distantthought, in the old unhappy loss or want of something never to be realized, ofwhich I had been sensible.

I could not have borne to lose the smallestportion of her sisterly affection; yet, in that betrayal, I should have set a constraintbetween us hitherto unknown.\\nI could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded me had grown up\\nin my own free choice and course. That if she had ever loved me with another love—and I sometimes thought the time was when she might have done so—I had castit away. It was nothing, now, that I had accustomed myself to think of her, whenwe were both mere children, as one who was far removed from my wild fancies. Ihad bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object; and what I  mighthave done, I had not done; and what Agnes was to me, I and her own noble hearthad made her.\\nIn the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me, when I tried to get a\\nbetter understanding of myself and be a better man, I did glance, through  someindefinite probation, to a period when I might possibly hope to cancel the mistakenpast, and to be so blessed as to marry her. But, as time wore on, this  shadowyprospect faded, and departed from me. If she had ever loved me,  then,  I  shouldhold her the more sacred; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her, herknowledge of my errant heart, the sacrifice she must have made to be my friendand sister, and the victory she had won. If she had never loved me, could I believethat she would love me now?\\nI had always felt my weakness, in comparison with her constancy  and  fortitude;\\nand now I felt it more and more.

I made no effort to conceal from myself,now, that I loved her, that I was devoted to her; but I brought the assurance hometo myself, that it was now too late, and that our long-subsisting relation must beundisturbed.\\nI had thought, much and often, of my Dora's shadowing out to me what might have\\nhappened, in those years that were destined not to try us; I had considered how thethings that never happen, are often as much realities to us, in their effects, as thosethat are accomplished. The very years she spoke of, were realities now, for mycorrection; and would have been, one day, a little later perhaps, though  we  hadparted in our earliest folly. I endeavoured to convert what might have beenbetween myself and Agnes, into a means of making me more self-denying, moreresolved, more conscious of myself, and my defects and errors.

RETURN\\nI landed in London on a wintry autumn evening. It was dark and raining, and I sawmore fog and mud in a minute than I had seen in a year. I walked from the CustomHouse to the Monument before I found a coach; and although the very house-fronts, looking on the swollen gutters, were like old friends to me, I could not butadmit that they were very dingy friends.\\nI have often remarked—I suppose everybody has—that one's going away from a\\nfamiliar place, would seem to be the signal for change in it. As I looked out of thecoach window, and observed that an old house on Fish-street Hill, which had stooduntouched by painter, carpenter, or bricklayer, for a century, had been pulled downin my absence; and that a neighbouring street, of time-honoured insalubrity  andinconvenience, was being drained and widened; I half expected to find St. Paul'sCathedral looking older.\\nFor some changes in the fortunes of my friends, I was prepared. My aunt had long\\nbeen re-established at Dover, and Traddles had begun to get into some littlepractice at the Bar, in the very first term after my departure. He had chambers inGray's Inn, now; and had told me, in his last letters, that he was not without hopesof being soon united to the dearest girl in the world.\\nThey expected me home before Christmas; but had no idea of my returning so\\nsoon. I had purposely misled them, that I might have the pleasure of taking them bysurprise. And yet, I was perverse enough to feel a chill and  disappointment  inreceiving no welcome, and rattling, alone and silent, through the misty streets.\\nThe well-known shops, however, with their cheerful lights, did something for me;\\nand when I alighted at the door of the Gray's Inn Coffee-house, I had recoveredmy spirits. It recalled, at first, that so-different time when I had put up at  theGolden Cross, and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then;but that was natural.\\n'Do you know where Mr. Traddles lives in the Inn?'

I meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak, andstood before the fire musing on his obscurity.\\nAs I followed the chief waiter with my eyes, I could not help thinking that  the\\ngarden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he was, was an arduousplace to rise in. It had such a prescriptive, stiff-necked, long-established, solemn,elderly air. I glanced about the room, which had had its sanded floor sanded, nodoubt, in exactly the same manner when the chief waiter was a boy—if he ever wasa boy, which appeared improbable; and at the shining tables, where I saw myselfreflected, in unruffled depths of old mahogany; and at the lamps, without a flaw intheir trimming or cleaning; and at the comfortable green curtains, with their purebrass rods, snugly enclosing the boxes; and at the two large coal fires, brightlyburning; and at the rows of decanters, burly as if with the consciousness of pipes ofexpensive old port wine below; and both England, and the law, appeared to me tobe very difficult indeed to be taken by storm. I went up to my bedroom to changemy wet clothes; and the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment (which wasover the archway leading to the Inn, I remember), and the sedate immensity of thefour-post bedstead, and the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers, all seemedto unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of Traddles, or on any such daringyouth. I came down again to my dinner; and even the slow comfort of the meal,and the orderly silence of the place—which was bare of guests, the Long Vacationnot yet being over—were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles, and his small hopesof a livelihood for twenty years to come.\\nI had seen nothing like this since I went away, and it quite dashed my hopes for my\\nfriend. The chief waiter had had enough of me. He came near me  no more;  butdevoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters, to meet whom a pint of specialport seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord, for he gave no order. Thesecond waiter informed me, in a whisper, that this old gentleman was a retiredconveyancer living in the Square, and worth a mint of money, which it  wasexpected he would leave to his laundress's daughter; likewise that it was rumouredthat he had a service of plate in a bureau, all tarnished with lying by, though more\"),\n",

'It's very agreeable to\\nhear. It quite lights up these old rooms. To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow whohas lived alone all his life, you know, it's positively delicious. It's charming. Poorthings, they have had a great loss in Sophy—who, I do assure you, Copperfield is,and ever was, the dearest girl!—and it gratifies me beyond expression to find themin such good spirits. The society of girls is a very delightful thing, Copperfield. It'snot professional, but it's very delightful.'\\nObserving that he slightly faltered, and comprehending that in the goodness of his\\nheart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he had said, I expressed myconcurrence with a heartiness that evidently relieved and pleased him greatly.\\n'But then,' said Traddles, 'our domestic arrangements are, to say the truth, quite\\nunprofessional altogether, my dear Copperfield. Even Sophy's being here, isunprofessional. And we have no other place of abode. We have put to sea  in  acockboat, but we are quite prepared to rough it. And Sophy's an  extraordinarymanager! You'll be surprised how those girls are stowed away. I am sure I hardlyknow how it's done!'\\n'Are many of the young ladies with you?' I inquired.'The eldest, the Beauty is here,' said Traddles, in a low confidential voice, 'Caroline.\\nAnd Sarah's here—the one I mentioned to you as having something the matter withher spine, you know. Immensely better! And the two youngest that Sophy educatedare with us. And Louisa's here.'\\n'Indeed!' cried I.'Yes,' said Traddles. 'Now the whole set—I mean the chambers—is only three\\nrooms; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way, and they sleepas comfortably as possible. Three in that room,' said Traddles, pointing.  'Two  inthat.'\\nI could not help glancing round, in search of the accommodation remaining for Mr.\\nand Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me.\\n'Well!' said Traddles, 'we are prepared to rough it, as I said just now, and we did\\nimprovise a bed last week, upon the floor here. But there's a little room in the roof—a very nice room, when you're up there—which Sophy papered herself, tosurprise me; and that's our room at present. It's a capital little gipsy sort of  place.There's quite a view from it.'\\n'And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles!' said I.

But they're Britannia metal.'\\n'The silver will be the brighter when it comes,' said I.\\n'The very thing we say!' cried Traddles. 'You see, my dear Copperfield,' falling\\nagain into the low confidential tone, 'after I had delivered my  argument  in  DOEdem. JIPES versus WIGZIELL, which did me great service with the profession, Iwent down into Devonshire, and had some serious conversation in private with theReverend Horace. I dwelt upon the fact that Sophy—who I do assure you,Copperfield, is the dearest girl!—'\\n'I am certain she is!' said I.'She is, indeed!' rejoined Traddles. 'But I am afraid I am wandering from the\\nsubject. Did I mention the Reverend Horace?'\\n'You said that you dwelt upon the fact—''True! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long period, and that\\nSophy, with the permission of her parents, was more than content to take me—inshort,' said Traddles, with his old frank smile, 'on our present Britannia-metalfooting. Very well. I then proposed to the Reverend Horace—who is a mostexcellent clergyman, Copperfield, and ought to be a Bishop; or at least ought tohave enough to live upon, without pinching himself—that if I could turn the corner,say of two hundred and fifty pounds, in one year; and could see  my  way  prettyclearly to that, or something better, next year; and could plainly furnish a littleplace like this, besides; then, and in that case, Sophy and I should be united. I tookthe liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years; and thatthe circumstance of Sophy's being extraordinarily useful at home, ought not  tooperate with her affectionate parents, against her establishment in life—don't yousee?'\\n'Certainly it ought not,' said I.'I am glad you think so, Copperfield,' rejoined Traddles, 'because, without any\\nimputation on the Reverend Horace, I do think parents, and brothers, and so forth,are sometimes rather selfish in such cases. Well! I also pointed  out, that  my mostearnest desire was, to be useful to the family; and that if I got on in the world, andanything should happen to him—I refer to the Reverend Horace—'\\n'I understand,' said I.'—Or to Mrs. Crewler—it would be the utmost gratification of my wishes, to be a\\nparent to the girls. He replied in a most admirable manner, exceedingly flattering tomy feelings, and undertook to obtain the consent of Mrs. Crewler to thisarrangement. They had a dreadful time of it with her. It mounted from her legs intoher chest, and then into her head—'\\n'What mounted?' I asked.'Her grief,' replied Traddles, with a serious look. 'Her feelings generally. As I\\nmentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior woman, but has lost the useof her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass her, usually settles in her legs; but on thisoccasion it mounted to the chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded  thewhole system in a most alarming manner. However, they brought her through it byunremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday six weeks.You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when I saw the whole familycrying and fainting away in every direction!

I had a delightful letter from her, only this\\nmorning.'\\n'And in short, my dear friend,' said I, 'you feel as blest as you deserve to feel!''Oh! That's your partiality!' laughed Traddles. 'But, indeed, I am in a most enviable\\nstate. I work hard, and read Law insatiably. I get up at five  every  morning,  anddon't mind it at all. I hide the girls in the daytime, and make merry with them in theevening. And I assure you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday,which is the day before the first day of Michaelmas Term. But here,' said Traddles,breaking off in his confidence, and speaking aloud, 'ARE the girls! Mr.Copperfield, Miss Crewler—Miss Sarah—Miss Louisa—Margaret and Lucy!'\\nThey were a perfect nest of roses; they looked so wholesome and fresh. They were\\nall pretty, and Miss Caroline was very handsome; but there was a loving, cheerful,fireside quality in Sophy's bright looks, which was better than that, and  whichassured me that my friend had chosen well. We all sat round the  fire;  while  thesharp boy, who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out, clearedthem away again, and produced the tea-things. After that, he retired for the night,shutting the outer door upon us with a bang. Mrs. Traddles, with perfect pleasureand composure beaming from her household eyes, having made the tea, thenquietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire.\\nShe had seen Agnes, she told me while she was toasting. 'Tom' had taken her down\\ninto Kent for a wedding trip, and there she had seen my aunt, too; and both myaunt and Agnes were well, and they had all talked of nothing but me. 'Tom' hadnever had me out of his thoughts, she really believed, all the time I had been away.'Tom' was the authority for everything. 'Tom' was evidently the idol of her  life;never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion; always to be believed in,and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart, come what might.\\nThe deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty, pleased\\nme very much. I don't know that I thought it very reasonable; but I thought it verydelightful, and essentially a part of their character. If Traddles ever for an instantmissed the tea-spoons that were still to be won, I have no doubt it was when hehanded the Beauty her tea. If his sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion against anyone, I am satisfied it could only have been because she wasthe Beauty's sister. A few slight indications of a rather petted and  capriciousmanner, which I observed in the Beauty, were manifestly considered, by Traddlesand his wife, as her birthright and natural endowment. If she had been born aQueen Bee, and they labouring Bees, they could not have been more satisfied ofthat.\\nBut their self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride in these girls, and their\\nsubmission of themselves to all their whims, was the pleasantest little testimony totheir own worth I could have desired to see. If Traddles were addressed as  'adarling', once in the course of that evening; and besought to bring something here,or carry something there, or take something up, or put something down, or  findsomething, or fetch something, he was so addressed, by one or other of his sisters-in-law, at least twelve times in an hour. Neither could they do anything  withoutSophy. Somebody's hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy could put it up.Somebody forgot how a particular tune went, and nobody but Sophy  could  humthat tune right. Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in Devonshire, andonly Sophy knew it. Something was wanted to be written home, and Sophy alonecould be trusted to write before breakfast in the morning.

They were entire mistresses of the place, and Sophy and Traddles waited\\non them. How many children Sophy could have taken care of in her time, I can'timagine; but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that ever wasaddressed to a child in the English tongue; and she sang dozens to order with theclearest little voice in the world, one after another (every sister issuing directionsfor a different tune, and the Beauty generally striking in last), so that  I was quitefascinated. The best of all was, that, in the midst of their exactions, all  the sistershad a great tenderness and respect both for Sophy and Traddles. I am sure, when Itook my leave, and Traddles was coming out to walk with me to the coffee-house, Ithought I had never seen an obstinate head of hair, or any other head  of  hair,rolling about in such a shower of kisses.\\nAltogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure, for a long\\ntime after I got back and had wished Traddles good night. If I had beheld athousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers, in that withered Gray's Inn, theycould not have brightened it half so much. The idea of those Devonshire girls,among the dry law-stationers and the attorneys' offices; and of the tea and toast,and children's songs, in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, red-tape,dusty wafers, ink-jars, brief and draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, andbills of costs; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that  theSultan's famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys, and had broughtthe talking bird, the singing tree, and the golden water into Gray's Inn  Hall.Somehow, I found that I had taken leave of Traddles for the night, and come backto the coffee-house, with a great change in my despondency about him. I began tothink he would get on, in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England.\\nDrawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think about him  at  my\\nleisure, I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospectsin the live-coals, and to thinking, as they broke and changed, of the  principalvicissitudes and separations that had marked my life. I had not seen a  coal  fire,since I had left England three years ago: though many a wood fire had I watched,as it crumbled into hoary ashes, and mingled with the feathery heap upon thehearth, which not inaptly figured to me, in my despondency, my own dead hopes.\\nI could think of the past now, gravely, but not bitterly; and could contemplate the\\nfuture in a brave spirit. Home, in its best sense, was for me no more. She in whom Imight have inspired a dearer love, I had taught to be my sister. She would marry,and would have new claimants on her tenderness; and in doing it, would neverknow the love for her that had grown up in my heart. It was right that I should paythe forfeit of my headlong passion. What I reaped, I had sown.\\nI was thinking. And had I truly disciplined my heart to this, and could I resolutely\\nbear it, and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in mine,—when I found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of thefire, in its association with my early remembrances.\\nLittle Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted in the very first\\nchapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an oppositecorner.

I have noright to speak.'\\n'If it should be so,' I repeated, 'Agnes will tell me at her own good time. A sister to\\nwhom I have confided so much, aunt, will not be reluctant to confide in me.'\\nMy aunt withdrew her eyes from mine, as slowly as she had turned them upon me;\\nand covered them thoughtfully with her hand. By and by she put her other hand onmy shoulder; and so we both sat, looking into the past, without saying anotherword, until we parted for the night.\\nI rode away, early in the morning, for the scene of my old school-days. I cannot\\nsay that I was yet quite happy, in the hope that I was gaining a victory over myself;even in the prospect of so soon looking on her face again.\\nThe well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and I came into the quiet streets,\\nwhere every stone was a boy's book to me. I went on foot to the old house, andwent away with a heart too full to enter. I returned; and looking, as  I  passed,through the low window of the turret-room where first Uriah Heep, and afterwardsMr. Micawber, had been wont to sit, saw that it was a little parlour now, and thatthere was no office. Otherwise the staid old house was, as to  its  cleanliness  andorder, still just as it had been when I first saw it. I requested the new maid  whoadmitted me, to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman who waited on her  from  afriend abroad, was there; and I was shown up the grave old staircase (cautioned ofthe steps I knew so well), into the unchanged drawing-room. The books that Agnesand I had read together, were on their shelves; and the desk where I had labouredat my lessons, many a night, stood yet at the same old corner of the table. All thelittle changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there, were  changed  again.Everything was as it used to be, in the happy time.\\nI stood in a window, and looked across the ancient street at the opposite houses,\\nrecalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons, when I first came there; andhow I had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows,and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs, while women wentclicking along the pavement in pattens, and the dull rain fell in slanting lines, andpoured out of the water-spout yonder, and flowed into the road. The feeling withwhich I used to watch the tramps, as they came into the town on those wetevenings, at dusk, and limped past, with their bundles drooping over their shouldersat the ends of sticks, came freshly back to me; fraught, as then, with the smell ofdamp earth, and wet leaves and briar, and the sensation of the very airs that  blewupon me in my own toilsome journey.\\nThe opening of the little door in the panelled wall made me start and  turn.  Her\\nbeautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me. She stopped  and laid  herhand upon her bosom, and I caught her in my arms.\"),\n",

I AM SHOWN TWO\\nINTERESTING PENITENTS\\nFor a time—at all events until my book should be completed, which would be the\\nwork of several months—I took up my abode in my aunt's house  at  Dover;  andthere, sitting in the window from which I had looked out at the moon upon the sea,when that roof first gave me shelter, I quietly pursued my task.\\nIn pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course\\nshould incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story, I do not  enter onthe aspirations, the delights, anxieties, and triumphs of my art.

If the books I have written be of any worth, they willsupply the rest. I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose, and the rest will beof interest to no one.\\nOccasionally, I went to London; to lose myself in the swarm of life  there,  or  to\\nconsult with Traddles on some business point. He had managed for me, in myabsence, with the soundest judgement; and my worldly affairs were prospering. Asmy notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from peopleof whom I had no knowledge—chiefly about nothing, and extremely difficult  toanswer—I agreed with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door. There,the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me;  and there, atintervals, I laboured through them, like a Home Secretary of State without  thesalary.\\nAmong this correspondence, there dropped in, every now and then, an obliging\\nproposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking about the Commons,to practise under cover of my name (if I would take the necessary steps remainingto make a proctor of myself), and pay me a percentage on the profits. But Ideclined these offers; being already aware that there were plenty of such  covertpractitioners in existence, and considering the Commons quite bad enough, withoutmy doing anything to make it worse.\\nThe girls had gone home, when my name burst into bloom on Traddles's door; and\\nthe sharp boy looked, all day, as if he had never heard of Sophy, shut up in a backroom, glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pumpin it. But there I always found her, the same bright housewife; often humming herDevonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs, and blunting thesharp boy in his official closet with melody.\\nI wondered, at first, why I so often found Sophy writing in a copy-book; and why\\nshe always shut it up when I appeared, and hurried it into the table-drawer. But thesecret soon came out. One day, Traddles (who had just come home  through  thedrizzling sleet from Court) took a paper out of his desk, and asked me what Ithought of that handwriting?\\n'Oh, DON'T, Tom!' cried Sophy, who was warming his slippers before the fire.'My dear,' returned Tom, in a delighted state, 'why not? What do you say to that\\nwriting, Copperfield?'\\n'It's extraordinarily legal and formal,' said I.

'Bricks and mortar are more like a lady's hand!'\\nTraddles broke into a rapturous laugh, and informed me that it was Sophy's writing;\\nthat Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a copying-clerk soon, and shewould be that clerk; that she had acquired this hand from a pattern; and that  shecould throw off—I forget how many folios an hour. Sophy was very muchconfused by my being told all this, and said that when 'Tom' was made a judge hewouldn't be so ready to proclaim it. Which 'Tom' denied; averring that he shouldalways be equally proud of it, under all circumstances.\\n'What a thoroughly good and charming wife she is, my dear Traddles!' said I, when\\nshe had gone away, laughing.\\n'My dear Copperfield,' returned Traddles, 'she is, without any exception, the dearest\\ngirl! The way she manages this place; her punctuality, domestic knowledge,economy, and order; her cheerfulness, Copperfield!'\\n'Indeed, you have reason to commend her!' I returned. 'You are a happy fellow. I\\nbelieve you make yourselves, and each other, two of the happiest people in  theworld.'\\n'I am sure we ARE two of the happiest people,' returned Traddles. 'I admit that, at\\nall events. Bless my soul, when I see her getting up by candle -light on these  darkmornings, busying herself in the day's arrangements, going out to market before theclerks come into the Inn, caring for no weather, devising the most capital littledinners out of the plainest materials, making puddings and pies, keeping everythingin its right place, always so neat and ornamental herself, sitting up at night with meif it's ever so late, sweet-tempered and encouraging always, and all for me, Ipositively sometimes can't believe it, Copperfield!'\\nHe was tender of the very slippers she had been warming, as he put them  on, and\\nstretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender.\\n'I positively sometimes can't believe it,' said Traddles. 'Then our  pleasures!  Dear\\nme, they are inexpensive, but they are quite wonderful! When we are at home here,of an evening, and shut the outer door, and draw those curtains—which she made—where could we be more snug? When it's fine, and we go out  for a walk in theevening, the streets abound in enjoyment for us. We look into the glitteringwindows of the jewellers' shops; and I show Sophy which of the  diamond -eyedserpents, coiled up on white satin rising grounds, I would give her if I could affordit; and Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelledand engine-turned, and possessed of the horizontal lever-escape-movement, and allsorts of things, she would buy for me if she could afford it; and we pick out thespoons and forks, fish-slices, butter-knives, and sugar-tongs, we should both preferif we could both afford it; and really we go away as if we had got them! Then,when we stroll into the squares, and great streets, and see a house to let, sometimeswe look up at it, and say, how would THAT do, if I was made a judge? And weparcel it out—such a room for us, such rooms for the girls, and so forth; until wesettle to our satisfaction that it would do, or it wouldn't do, as the  case  may  be.Sometimes, we go at half-price to the pit of the theatre—the very smell of which ischeap, in my opinion, at the money—and there we thoroughly enjoy the play:which Sophy believes every word of, and so do I. In walking home, perhaps webuy a little bit of something at a cook's-shop, or a little lobster at the fishmongers,and bring it here, and make a splendid supper, chatting about what we have seen.Now, you know, Copperfield, if I was Lord Chancellor, we couldn't do this!'\"),\n",

It was an immense  andsolid building, erected at a vast expense. I could not help thinking, as weapproached the gate, what an uproar would have been made in the country, if anydeluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost, on the erectionof an industrial school for the young, or a house of refuge for the deserving old.\\nIn an office that might have been on the ground-floor of the Tower of Babel, it was\\nso massively constructed, we were presented to our old schoolmaster; who was oneof a group, composed of two or three of the busier sort of magistrates, and somevisitors they had brought. He received me, like a man who had formed my mind inbygone years, and had always loved me tenderly. On my introducing Traddles, Mr.Creakle expressed, in like manner, but in an inferior degree, that he  had  alwaysbeen Traddles's guide, philosopher, and friend. Our venerable instructor was a greatdeal older, and not improved in appearance. His face was as fiery as ever; his eyeswere as small, and rather deeper set. The scanty, wet-looking grey hair, by which Iremembered him, was almost gone; and the thick veins in his bald head were nonethe more agreeable to look at.\\nAfter some conversation among these gentlemen, from which I might have\\nsupposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately taken into accountbut the supreme comfort of prisoners, at any expense, and nothing on the wideearth to be done outside prison-doors, we began our inspection. It being then justdinner-time, we went, first into the great kitchen, where every prisoner's dinner wasin course of being set out separately (to be handed to him in his cell),  with  theregularity and precision of clock-work. I said aside, to Traddles, that I wonderedwhether it occurred to anybody, that there was a striking contrast between  theseplentiful repasts of choice quality, and the dinners, not to say of paupers, but ofsoldiers, sailors, labourers, the great bulk of the honest, working community; ofwhom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well. But I learned that  the'system' required high living; and, in short, to dispose of the system, once for all, Ifound that on that head and on all others, 'the system' put an end to all doubts, anddisposed of all anomalies. Nobody appeared to have the least idea that there wasany other system, but THE system, to be considered.\\nAs we were going through some of the magnificent passages, I inquired of  Mr.\\nCreakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages of this all-governing and universally over-riding system? I found them to be the perfectisolation of prisoners—so that no one man in confinement there, knew anythingabout another; and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind, leadingto sincere contrition and repentance.\\nNow, it struck me, when we began to visit individuals in their cells, and to traverse\\nthe passages in which those cells were, and to have the manner of the  going  tochapel and so forth, explained to us, that there was a strong probability of theprisoners knowing a good deal about each other, and of their carrying on a  prettycomplete system of intercourse. This, at the time I write, has been proved, Ibelieve, to be the case; but, as it would have been flat blasphemy against  thesystem to have hinted such a doubt then, I looked out for the penitence asdiligently as I could.\\nAnd here again, I had great misgivings. I found as prevalent a fashion in the form\\nof the penitence, as I had left outside in the forms of the coats and waistcoats in thewindows of the tailors' shops. I found a vast amount of profession, varying verylittle in character: varying very little (which I thought exceedingly suspicious),\"),\n",

I found a great many foxes, disparaging whole vineyards of\\ninaccessible grapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within\\nreach of a bunch. Above all, I found that the most professing men were the greatestobjects of interest; and that their conceit, their vanity, their want of excitement, andtheir love of deception (which many of them possessed to an almost incredibleextent, as their histories showed), all prompted to these professions, and were allgratified by them.\\nHowever, I heard so repeatedly, in the course of our goings to and fro, of a certain\\nNumber Twenty Seven, who was the Favourite, and who really appeared to be aModel Prisoner, that I resolved to suspend my judgement until I should see TwentySeven. Twenty Eight, I understood, was also a bright particular star; but it was hismisfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of TwentySeven. I heard so much of Twenty Seven, of his pious admonitions to everybodyaround him, and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother (whomhe seemed to consider in a very bad way), that I became quite impatient to see him.\\nI had to restrain my impatience for some time, on account of Twenty Seven being\\nreserved for a concluding effect. But, at last, we came to the door of his cell; andMr. Creakle, looking through a little hole in it, reported to us, in a state  of  thegreatest admiration, that he was reading a Hymn Book.\\nThere was such a rush of heads immediately, to see Number Twenty Seven reading\\nhis Hymn Book, that the little hole was blocked up, six or seven heads deep. Toremedy this inconvenience, and give us an opportunity of conversing with TwentySeven in all his purity, Mr. Creakle directed the door of the cell to be unlocked,and Twenty Seven to be invited out into the passage. This was done; and whomshould Traddles and I then behold, to our amazement, in this converted NumberTwenty Seven, but Uriah Heep!\\nHe knew us directly; and said, as he came out—with the old writhe,—'How do you do, Mr. Copperfield? How do you do, Mr. Traddles?'This recognition caused a general admiration in the party. I rather thought that\\neveryone was struck by his not being proud, and taking notice of us.\\n'Well, Twenty Seven,' said Mr. Creakle, mournfully admiring him.

However loud the general voice might be ingiving me encouragement, and however fervent the emotions and endeavours towhich it roused me, I heard her lightest word of praise as I heard nothing else.\\nAt least once a week, and sometimes oftener, I rode over there, and passed  the\\nevening. I usually rode back at night; for the old unhappy sense was alwayshovering about me now—most sorrowfully when I left her—and I was glad to beup and out, rather than wandering over the past in weary wakefulness or miserabledreams. I wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights, in  those  rides;reviving, as I went, the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence.\\nOr, if I were to say rather that I listened to the echoes of those thoughts, I should\\nbetter express the truth. They spoke to me from afar off. I had put them  at  adistance, and accepted my inevitable place. When I read to Agnes what I wrote;when I saw her listening face; moved her to smiles or tears; and heard her cordialvoice so earnest on the shadowy events of that imaginative world in which I lived;I thought what a fate mine might have been—but only thought so, as I had thoughtafter I was married to Dora, what I could have wished my wife to be.\\nMy duty to Agnes, who loved me with a love, which, if I disquieted, I wronged\\nmost selfishly and poorly, and could never restore; my matured assurance that I,who had worked out my own destiny, and won what I had impetuously  set  myheart on, had no right to murmur, and must bear; comprised what I felt and what Ihad learned. But I loved her: and now it even became some consolation to  me,vaguely to conceive a distant day when I might blamelessly avow it; when all thisshould be over; when I could say 'Agnes, so it was when I came home; and now Iam old, and I never have loved since!'\\nShe did not once show me any change in herself.

I believed that she had read, or partly read, my thoughts that night; and thatshe fully comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression.\\nThis Christmas-time being come, and Agnes having reposed no new confidence in\\nme, a doubt that had several times arisen in my mind—whether she could have thatperception of the true state of my breast, which restrained her with theapprehension of giving me pain—began to oppress me heavily.

It is estimatedthat not fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with dinnerat one time, exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs. The beauty,fashion, and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay, flocked to do honour to one sodeservedly esteemed, so highly talented, and so widely popular. Doctor  Mell  (ofColonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, and on hisright sat the distinguished guest. After the removal of the cloth, and the singing ofNon Nobis (beautifully executed, and in which we were at no loss to distinguishthe bell-like notes of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE,JUNIOR), the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturouslyreceived. Doctor Mell, in a speech replete with feeling, then proposed \"Ourdistinguished Guest, the ornament of our town. May he never leave us but to betterhimself, and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himselfimpossible!\" The cheering with which the toast was received defies description.Again and again it rose and fell, like the waves of ocean. At length all was hushed,and WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, presented himself to return thanks. Far beit from us, in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of ourestablishment, to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through thesmoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address! Suffice it toobserve, that it was a masterpiece of eloquence; and that those passages in whichhe more particularly traced his own successful career to its source, and warned theyounger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniaryliabilities which they were unable to liquidate, brought a tear into the manliest eyepresent. The remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL; Mrs. MICAWBER (whogracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the side-door, where a galaxy ofbeauty was elevated on chairs, at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene),Mrs. RIDGER BEGS (late Miss Micawber); Mrs. MELL; WILKINS MICAWBER,ESQUIRE, JUNIOR (who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking thathe found himself unable to return thanks in a speech, but would do so,  with theirpermission, in a song); Mrs. MICAWBER\\'S FAMILY (well known, it is needlessto remark, in the mother-country), &c. &c. &c. At the conclusion of theproceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic for dancing. Among thevotaries of TERPSICHORE, who disported themselves until Sol gave warning fordeparture, Wilkins Micawber, Esquire, Junior, and the lovely and accomplishedMiss Helena, fourth daughter of Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable.\\'\\nI was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have discovered,  in\\nthese happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor pinched usher to myMiddlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing to another part of the paper, myeyes rested on my own name, and I read thus:\\n\\'TO DAVID COPPERFIELD, ESQUIRE,\\n\\'THE EMINENT AUTHOR.'),\n",

My aunt's old disappointment is set right, now. She is godmother toa real living Betsey Trotwood; and Dora (the next in order) says she spoils her.\\nThere is something bulky in Peggotty's pocket. It is nothing smaller than  the\\nCrocodile Book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time, with diversof the leaves torn and stitched across, but which Peggotty exhibits to the children asa precious relic.

But Juliakeeps no diary in these days; never sings Affection's Dirge; eternally quarrels withthe old Scotch Croesus, who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide. Julia issteeped in money to the throat, and talks and thinks of nothing else.  I  liked  herbetter in the Desert of Sahara.\\nOr perhaps this IS the Desert of Sahara! For, though Julia has a stately house, and\\nmighty company, and sumptuous dinners every day, I see no green  growth  nearher; nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower. What Julia calls 'society', I see;among it Mr. Jack Maldon, from his Patent Place, sneering at the hand that gave ithim, and speaking to me of the Doctor as 'so charmingly antique'.

It is a large house;  butTraddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room and his boots with his papers; andhe and Sophy squeeze themselves into upper rooms, reserving the best bedroomsfor the Beauty and the girls. There is no room to spare in the house; for more of'the girls' are here, and always are here, by some accident or other, than I knowhow to count. Here, when we go in, is a crowd of them, running down to the door,and handing Traddles about to be kissed, until he is out of breath. Here, establishedin perpetuity, is the poor Beauty, a widow with a little girl; here, at dinner onSophy's birthday, are the three married girls with their three husbands, and one ofthe husband's brothers, and another husband's cousin, and another husband's sister,who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the same simple,unaffected fellow as he ever was, sits at the foot of the large table like a Patriarch;and Sophy beams upon him, from the head, across a cheerful space that is certainlynot glittering with Britannia metal.\\nAnd now, as I close my task, subduing my desire to linger yet,  these  faces  fade\\naway.

She immediately recognized this woman as Miss Betsey, an old acquaintance of theirs. Miss Betsey was known for her stern demeanor and authoritative presence.\\n\\nWhen Miss Betsey entered the house, she greeted my mother with a formal \"Mrs. David Copperfield,\" emphasizing her mourning attire and condition. My mother was overcome with emotion and cried until she had finished.\\n\\nMiss Betsey then sat down in a chair by the fire, frowning at it as if trying to intimidate it. She suddenly asked why their house was called Rookery, implying that it would have been more suitable to call it Cookery instead. This question seemed to unsettle Miss Betsey herself, and she rose from her seat, only to sit back down again and faint.\\n\\nWhen Miss Betsey came to, she stood at the window, looking out into the twilight. My mother asked if she thought tea would do her any good, but Miss Betsey simply told her to have some anyway.\\n\\nThe narrator\\'s mother then called out for Peggotty, a servant in their household, but Miss Betsey corrected her, saying that it was actually \"Peggotty\" who had been the recognized authority in the house. This seemed to startle Miss Betsey, and she shut the door again, sitting back down by the fire.\\n\\nThe narrator reflects on this scene, noting that their mother was too scared and uneasy to observe much of what was happening or know how to respond.',\n",

He went to India with his capital, where he died within ten years. The news of his death affected Miss Betsey deeply, but she kept it private.\\n\\n**Miss Betsey's Visit**\\n\\nWhen Miss Betsey arrives at the narrator's home, she is met by his mother, who is sitting by the fire.

She sits down with my mother and begins to discuss their family history.\\n\\n**Discussion of David Copperfield**\\n\\nMiss Betsey mentions the narrator (David Copperfield) and expresses her disapproval of his behavior, particularly his association with a woman named Peggotty.

The narrator then shifts focus to their own birth and family history.\\n\\n**Section 2**\\n\\nThe narrator was born at Blunderstone, Suffolk, six months after their father\\'s death. They were a posthumous child, meaning they were born after their father had passed away. The narrator reflects on the strange feeling of never having seen their father and their early associations with his grave in the churchyard.\\n\\n**Section 3**\\n\\nThe narrator mentions an aunt of their father\\'s, Miss Betsey, who had bought a cottage on the sea coast and lived a secluded life. She was affronted by her brother\\'s marriage to the narrator\\'s mother, whom she considered too young (not yet 20) and not suitable for her brother.\\n\\n**Section 4**\\n\\nThe narrator describes the scene at their home on an important Friday afternoon. Their mother is sitting by the fire, poorly in health and low in spirits, looking through tears at a drawer upstairs where prophetic pins are kept. Miss Betsey arrives and demands to see the narrator\\'s face, calling them a \"very Baby\".\\n\\n**Section 5**\\n\\nMiss Betsey makes some comments about the narrator\\'s appearance and their mother\\'s youthfulness. The narrator\\'s mother is afraid of Miss Betsey and hangs her head in shame. Miss Betsey insists that she will be well brought up and guarded from making foolish confidences, suggesting that there are old wrongs within her that need to be repressed.\\n\\nOverall, the text sets the stage for a story about the narrator\\'s family history, their relationships with their relatives, and the complexities of their mother\\'s situation.',\n",

However, Miss Betsey is skeptical, pointing out that there are no rooks near the house and that the nests they see must have been abandoned for a long time.\\n\\nThe conversation then turns to the topic of my mother\\'s pregnancy.
